April was a month for movement and enactment on good and bad bills around the country. We will highlight those with the most potential impact to membership, but everyone is encouraged to read through the list of bills in your respective state(s) to make sure you have the latest information available. Apprentice/Labor Colorado SB 19 196 adds several required evaluation factors including the craft labor staffing plan for the project bidder and subcontractors, the anticipated utilization by the bidder and its subcontractors of apprentices registered with federal or state apprenticeship agencies to complete the work under the contract, and the safety plan and safety record of the bidder and the bidder's subcontractors. It will require bidders for contracts over $1 million to demonstrate use of approved apprenticeship programs for labor used to complete the project. This bill passed the Senate on April 16th and was sent to the House, where it was assigned to the State, Veterans, & Military Affairs Committee. It passed the House with amendments on April 29th and on April 30, 2019 the Senate considered the House amendments, concurred, and voted to repass. Illinois SB 1474 is touted as a ""collective bargaining freedom"" bill, but in reality, creates a framework that would require membership in labor unions where collective bargaining agreements are reached. This bill was enacted on April 12, 2019. Maine LD 1564 (SP 499) provides for the ability of a public works project to include a project labor agreement, but conditions on the agreement would prohibit any provision that requires increased costs, construction delays, or forced participation in a labor union as a condition of the agreement. Nevada SB 207, which requires contractors and subcontractors to comply with apprenticeship requirements was passed in the Senate on April 19th and is now headed to the House. The bill was amended to increase the percentage of time required for approved apprentices on public works projects. Arkansas SB 564 and Arizona HB 2569 are two of several bills around the country that provide for expedited licensing for veterans, returning veterans and their spouses who are licensed in another state. Both bills were enacted on April 10, 2019. Idaho HB 248 provides for training and experience equivalency for the purposes of occupational licensing of applicants with honorable military experience. It also provides for expedited licensing requirements. This bill was enacted into law on April 3, 2019. The Tennessee bills (SB 1443 and HB 602) that would prohibit local governments from using alarm companies as collection agents to collect their annual alarm registration fees and from fining alarm companies for false alarms continued to move in April. SB 1443 passed the Senate and House and was forwarded to the Governor on April 30, 2019 where it awaits his signature. A bill in Colorado is cause for some concern and confusion. SB 19 156 is the sunset bill for the State Electrical Board. The bill itself makes no mention of anything other than extending the powers and duties of the board for 13 years, adding at least one residential electrician to the board and several other changes that do not impact our industry. However, the fiscal note summary provides bullet points on what this bill does, including one bullet point that claims the bill, ""clarifies that communications systems, data systems, and security systems are subject to regulation if they are part of a building's electrical system . . ."" We have not identified the source of this language, but we do know that security systems are not included in the most recently published version of the bill. This bill passed the House on April 30, 2019 and the Senate concurred with the amendments passed by the House on May 1st. ND HB 1157, which was dramatically altered after it passed the House, passed the Senate and after a conference committee was convened passed the House with amendments. The enrolled version was sent to the Governor on April 24th. This bill will create a ""power limited electrician"" license, but exempts persons installing what is referred to in the bill as ""nonelectrical systems"". The definition of a nonelectrical system is defined as ""a system as defined by the articles contained in chapter 8 and other articles which contains class II or class III circuits and systems as defined by the national electrical code, as adopted by the board. Although the board may expand this definition, the board may not narrow this definition. The term does not include a circuit or system that is installed: a. Within an area of special occupancies, as defined under articles 500 through 517 of the national electrical code. b. For heat, light, or power. c. For the control of heat, light, or power, unless the circuit or system employs digital communication."" There remains some confusion on how this new law will be interpreted, particularly the term ""digital communication."" We will have to see how this new legislation will also be viewed in light of SB 2359, which mandates the study of power limited systems.

It will require bidders for contracts over $1 million to demonstrate use of approved apprenticeship programs for labor used to complete the project. This bill passed the Senate on April 16th and was sent to the House, where it was assigned to the State, Veterans, & Military Affairs Committee. It passed the House with amendments on April 29th and on April 30, 2019 the Senate considered the House amendments, concurred, and voted to repass. Illinois SB 1474 is touted as a ""collective bargaining freedom"" bill, but in reality, creates a framework that would require membership in labor unions where collective bargaining agreements are reached. This bill was enacted on April 12, 2019. Maine LD 1564 (SP 499) provides for the ability of a public works project to include a project labor agreement, but conditions on the agreement would prohibit any provision that requires increased costs, construction delays, or forced participation in a labor union as a condition of the agreement. Nevada SB 207, which requires contractors and subcontractors to comply with apprenticeship requirements was passed in the Senate on April 19th and is now headed to the House. The bill was amended to increase the percentage of time required for approved apprentices on public works projects. Arkansas SB 564 and Arizona HB 2569 are two of several bills around the country that provide for expedited licensing for veterans, returning veterans and their spouses who are licensed in another state. Both bills were enacted on April 10, 2019. Idaho HB 248 provides for training and experience equivalency for the purposes of occupational licensing of applicants with honorable military experience. It also provides for expedited licensing requirements. This bill was enacted into law on April 3, 2019. The Tennessee bills (SB 1443 and HB 602) that would prohibit local governments from using alarm companies as collection agents to collect their annual alarm registration fees and from fining alarm companies for false alarms continued to move in April. SB 1443 passed the Senate and House and was forwarded to the Governor on April 30, 2019 where it awaits his signature. A bill in Colorado is cause for some concern and confusion. SB 19 156 is the sunset bill for the State Electrical Board. The bill itself makes no mention of anything other than extending the powers and duties of the board for 13 years, adding at least one residential electrician to the board and several other changes that do not impact our industry. However, the fiscal note summary provides bullet points on what this bill does, including one bullet point that claims the bill, ""clarifies that communications systems, data systems, and security systems are subject to regulation if they are part of a building's electrical system . . ."" We have not identified the source of this language, but we do know that security systems are not included in the most recently published version of the bill. This bill passed the House on April 30, 2019 and the Senate concurred with the amendments passed by the House on May 1st. ND HB 1157, which was dramatically altered after it passed the House, passed the Senate and after a conference committee was convened passed the House with amendments. The enrolled version was sent to the Governor on April 24th. This bill will create a ""power limited electrician"" license, but exempts persons installing what is referred to in the bill as ""nonelectrical systems"". The definition of a nonelectrical system is defined as ""a system as defined by the articles contained in chapter 8 and other articles which contains class II or class III circuits and systems as defined by the national electrical code, as adopted by the board. Although the board may expand this definition, the board may not narrow this definition. The term does not include a circuit or system that is installed: a. Within an area of special occupancies, as defined under articles 500 through 517 of the national electrical code. b. For heat, light, or power. c. For the control of heat, light, or power, unless the circuit or system employs digital communication."" There remains some confusion on how this new law will be interpreted, particularly the term ""digital communication."" We will have to see how this new legislation will also be viewed in light of SB 2359, which mandates the study of power limited systems.

Parker Griffith will announce Tuesday that he's switching parties and will run for re election next year as a Republican. The freshman lawmaker represents Alabama's 5th Congressional District. Griffith won his seat last year by 3 points over Republican Wayne Parker. But the district went for Republican John McCain over Barack Obama by 23 points in the presidential election. The Republican source was familiar with the decision but didn't want to preempt the announcement later Tuesday. The story was first reported by Politico. A Democratic aide also tells CNN Griffith is holding a staff meeting Tuesday morning to inform his staff of his decision, and will make a formal announcement at 2 p.m. ET. Griffith was one of 39 Democrats who voted against the party's health care reform bill last month. His is only one of three Democrats to have voted against the health care bill, the stimulus measure, and the cap and trade bill. Griffith pledged in August he would vote against House Speaker Nancy Pelosi as Speaker next session. With Griffith's switch of parties, the Democrats will hold a 257 178 advantage in the House of Representatives. CNN's Evan Glass and Paul Steinhauser contributed to this story Filed under: Parker Griffith Alan Goldstein Go riddance to bad rubbish. December 22, 2009 02:35 pm at 2:35 pm | When will we see the day when someone run's; not for themselves? but for the good of the people. And that goes for both sides!!. What happened to making this country better for all people? Not just running for office to get what you can for yourself. If you don't get your way in the Dem party switch to the Rep. It's all about the $$$$$$ and the power. Not the PEOPLE!!! Hehehehe. Looks like some people are waking up to the Mao wanna be's in our government. The libtards are going to get a beating in 2010. The Democrats don't need him. He probably was a Republican from inside. California_is_dying The Rats are fleeing the sinking ship !! Looks like that Hope and Change will happen next November..... Rebel With A Cause Don't let the door hit you on the way out, Bubba! Call Sessions and do some ""splainin"" as to why you ran as a Democrat in the first place. As a 23 year old Democrat living in Alabama's 5th Congressional district (the north part of the state think Huntsville, AL), and seeing his voting record, this is extremely disappointing but it does not surprise me. I will NOT be voting for Mr. Griffith as a Republican in 2010, if he even gets the nomination. I had already planned on voting on whoever challenged him in the Democratic primaries next year anyway. Good riddance, perhands we can elect an actual Democrat to represent us in 2010. Isn't he already a republican, For God's sake, he's from Alabama. All he needs is a hood and cloak. Walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, must be a republiduck, just ask Joe Lieberduck. Just follow the money.... This Independent says, ""Bravo!"" To all those that feel its wrong for him to swtich parties. How about the Specter switching and voting for so call health care reform?? I guess you are fine with that? How about breaking the standing rules in Mass about electing a new senator?? Forget the electoral process and just appoint someone becasue you need the vote. I guess you dont care about that either? How about Burris being sworn in while there is still questions about if he bought the seat? I guess you dont care abou tthat?? There are 3 votes that were obtained under questionable circumstances. Lets ignore for a moment the other votes that were bought with my tax dollars. Liberals house and senate members includes Reid will soon know what it feels like to be told you're fired!!!! now please help save this country! I'm from Alabama and the state votes along racial lines and just about every white person votes for a Republican, especially in the southern portion of the state. They're a bunch of bigots; you should hear my Republican family speak behind closed doors. These are the same people who just can't get over the fact that Obama is actually a Christian and still believe he's a closet Muslim! It's a wonder that guy ever got elected in Alabama as a Democrat to begin with. I'm glad I don't live there anymore. The ignorance there makes me sick. If this yahoo is a Republican at heart, I'm glad he's not posing anymore. Anyhow, the American people are a fickle bunch. The GOP truly is the Greedy Obstructionist Party. If Americans are so stupid that they'd vote more of the Republicans in, then we'll have to deal with that later. As for me, I'd like to not see another friend die because she didn't have insurance and ended up in a hospital that wanted their bed for the next person and forced her out twice instead of doing the tests that were needed. I'd also like to see our educational system improved so that we aren't the joke of the rest of the industrialized world! I decided I'd never vote as a Republican again when they couldn't even be bothered to fund schools. Ignorance is bliss if you run the GOP! Ron in Palm Springs Funny when this recently happened with Arlen Specter, the Libs praised him and how he had ""Seen the light"" & ""Had opened his eyes"". Now that the tables are turned it's ""OMG How could he do this to his voters"" or ""What a scumbag"". Hypocrites! Liberalism works great in Utopia, but not in Real Life. SouthPhillyBallz How utterly pointless. This guy's switch won't change his votes and is only an attempt to get re elected by his red state constituents. He was obviously never a Democrat in the first place. This is seriously a non issue. JK Ashburn, VA A whole bunch of you libs have been complaining about these moderate Dems and your desire to get rid of them. It has begun. Now, you'll valiantly talk about how you can run a ""real"" Dem to re capture the seat in 2010. Good luck with that. A whole bunch of these moderates won these seats ONLY because they campaigned as moderates (or even conservatives). With the reality of how they voted on idiotic things like stimulus, the budget, health care, and cap and trade, they'll now either be proven to be moderates or not and their districts will react accordingly. Either way, libs, you'll get your way fewer moderate Democrats. But, they won't be showing up in the lib column either. Griffith only won last year because he was running against an even bigger loser. There are two more popular Republicans already in the primary. 2010 will now almost certainly see the first Republican from the Alabama 5th since Reconstruction. And to whoever asked, yes Wallace was a democrat before he created a 3rd party. All of the pro segregation heavyweights were democrats. How quickly they forget... jm for sc Alabama is a republican state. He is switching parties because he want to win. Follow his career and see if he doesn't lose his next election. Obama will win his next election regardless of how people try to make things seem. How can people be so foolish to think this president can correct Bush's mess in only a few months. People really don't understand what is going on. Republicans will say anything to get back in power. Some can't stand the idea of having a black leader, which is the main problem for most people. I guess if they get to heaven and find that God is not of their race, they would want to live in hell. C Spurgeon Well with ethics like that he belongs in the republican party...Hopefully they can find a democrat to beat him but either way don't need wimps like that to pretend they are a dem... I'm just amazed. Here is another politician that's putting a political party first and the best interests of the country second. Who cares if he's a Republican or Democrat. Clearly this headline seeking tool is not a man of independent thought and needs to hide behind political party games. Neither party is good for this country, but this guy is just blowing with wind to get re elected. Alabama is a good for nothing, bible thumping, gay hating, sexist, racist, classist, anti semitic, republican, fly over black hole. We should charge the state for all of the war funding! He was just another dixiecrat. No big lost @ all. Mr Joshua Could be he saw Rasmuessens poll. 56 percent now disaprove of Obama's policies. He just does not want to be associated with a one term President that is going to be remembered far worse than Carter currently is. Ole Jimmy must be very happy! American Feminist ima goodblogger you realize that only 30% of registered voters call themselves true Republicans, right? Next election, those of us who are ""disenchanted"" with the Democrats aren't going to vote for a RepubliCANT. We just possibly won't vote. I'm not going to forget who screwed up our nation, and neither will the remaining 70% of voters. HINT: It wasn't the Democrats.","House Dem to switch to Republican Party Griffith is switching to the Republican Party. Washington (CNN) Sources confirm to CNN that Democratic Rep. Parker Griffith will announce Tuesday that he's switching parties and will run for re election next year as a Republican. The freshman lawmaker represents Alabama's 5th Congressional District. Griffith won his seat last year by 3 points over Republican Wayne Parker. But the district went for Republican John McCain over Barack Obama by 23 points in the presidential election. The Republican source was familiar with the decision but didn't want to preempt the announcement later Tuesday. The story was first reported by Politico. A Democratic aide also tells CNN Griffith is holding a staff meeting Tuesday morning to inform his staff of his decision, and will make a formal announcement at 2 p.m. ET. Griffith was one of 39 Democrats who voted against the party's health care reform bill last month. His is only one of three Democrats to have voted against the health care bill, the stimulus measure, and the cap and trade bill. Griffith pledged in August he would vote against House Speaker Nancy Pelosi as Speaker next session. With Griffith's switch of parties, the Democrats will hold a 257 178 advantage in the House of Representatives. CNN's Evan Glass and Paul Steinhauser contributed to this story Filed under: Parker Griffith Chris in NC Come on Heath. If Alabama can do it, so can North Carolina. December 22, 2009 03:13 pm at 3:13 pm | Parker Griffith? With a name like that, I am surpirsed he wasn' t already a Republican! Randy Sexton The PROOF will not be in his label of DEMOcrat or Republican, it will be in ACTIONS. It's never been more true than now that ACTIONS speak louder than words. We've heard the words of Prez ObeyMe, Nutcy Pelosi and Hairless Reid, among others, who have LIED, CHEATED, EXTORTED and BULLIED others into cramming bad legislation down our unwilling throats...We want people in Congress to get back to basics, SMALLer government, LESS taxation, LESS spending and MORE personal freedoms... Joe in CT not Lieberman!!! Remember, folks, he is running in Alabama. The last time they had a Democrat from that district was when LBJ passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, with no Southern Democrat and a lot of Republican support. The Republicans then offered the Southern Democrats home in their party. Talk about a three finger gagger! What if they manage to unseat Nancy Pelosi as Speaker of the House and replace her with someone who has a clue. Then will Griffith stay with the Democrats? If not, how will it feel to be the most junior member of the minority party? Perusing through WELL, WE ALL KNOW WHAT THIS IS ABOUT, , , , , It is called ""Self Preservation"" and doing what ever it takes to stay in office. Congressman Parker Griffith knows that after winning his Republican district by 3 points in the previous race, he can only hope to win his district which is full of Tea Baggers by putting on a Red Republican coat. He's a first term Democrat (in name only) from ALABAMA...what would you expect? The GOP owns the Deep South and visca versa. They were meant for each other! I love those ""open minded"" liberals who chose to respond to this story by showing their bigotry and trashing the state of Alabama and the South in general The same state that birthed such Americans as Harper Lee, Hank Aaron, and Rosa Parks. Disgusting. You should be ashamed. Shaun Landry Well, I guess the people who voted him in are not going to vote him back in for re election right? Oba Mao Most of the American people will be abandoning the socialist Democrats in 2010 and 2012, and maybe for a long time. They are committing suicide with this bill and others they are supporting. According to Rasmussen Obama's disaproval numbers have shot up to 56% since he BOUGHT the 60 votes and he has an approval index of 21. The mandate last year was to fix the economy, not socialize the country. They've ignored all the polls, the town halls, the tea parties, and the NJ and VA elections. Lets see if they can ignore the election results in 11 months when the Dems are sent packing. The good news is the bill can be undone before it goes into effext in 4 yrs. Mike in San Antonio Wow...I didn't hear the Dems all whining and complaining when Sen Arlen Specter did the same, except it was to the Democratic party. Will one of you liberal democrats please tell where exactly your hypocrisy ends? JoePoverty He'll be back. Alabama doesn't rank very high in terms of education, but even ignorant people will eventually understand that paying lower healthcare insurance premiums leaves them with more money to spend on other things like guns, TV's and BBQ. Once this goes into effect, Alabamans will be wondering why they bought in to the GOP's mis information campaign to protect Big Insurance. Parker You could have been a hero to the working poor of Alabama. How much did Healthsouth have to contribute to your campaign? Republicans get over it you have lost! and will not win 2010 With 35 million people uninsured, No !!American should die simply because they don't have health insurance , The 35 millions is not going to volt for you ? joec Good Job Mr. Griffith it is much better to be part of the minority than to be part of a party that takes bribes to pass legislation on 1/6th of the nations economy on a striaght party line vote. Goodbye Sen. Nelson from Nebraska your time is almost over in the Senate. Sailor Bob Look at all that hate from the left! It's in their usernames.. Jim Jeffords anybody? His defection actually cost the Republicans the majority. Libs seemed to approve of that defection. I love seeing them cry now over a mere single congressman...Keep spouting your sterotypes of the south..The only bigots here are Liberals Nathan from Atlanta He jumped to save his job. smlbusowner The bashing of the state of Alabama is amazing!!! FYI Madison County has more PHD's per capita then any other county in the U.S. We are educated and sick of liberals telling us what to do with our lives. Sorry that we are hard working, God fearing, family oriented people. Griffith switched parties because liberals stand for nothing but having more government run your life!!!!!",0.9234436

We here at The VPN Laboratory agree it is among the top 10 VPN providers offered. Servers run and provides VPN support that is great at prices that are reasonable. Will Torguard Work With Avast Click here to sign up to Torguard today. A VPN creates an encrypted tunnel between your PC And a VPN server. Your web traffic travels through this tube, meaning that anybody snooping around, even on the exact same system as you, will not find a thing. A VPN can also help safeguard your privacy, today that ISPs can market your data. ISPs have insight into your actions but not if you use a VPN. There is a VPN, Since it may secure an insecure network A vital tool when traveling or using that shifty, unsecured Wi Fi network in the local coffee shop. A VPN makes it more challenging to identify you online by hiding your true IP address, which may be used to determine your geographical location. Journalists and activists frequently use VPN services to Get around government censors so they can communicate with the external world. Most VPNs hang their reputation on being able to unblock blocked sites for such customers. You can use in order to watch BBC articles or MLB, for instance a VPN to spoof where you are. Note that Netflix is working to obstruct VPN trickery. Will Torguard Work With Avast To Start utilizing TorGuard, just download the appropriate app for your Operating system and follow the installation manual. You are able to pick between TorGuard Lite and Torguard Viscosity. The first one is a more straightforward client software, ideal for first time VPN users, whereas the latter is a better choice for tech savvy users. TorGuard Lite automatically joins the VPN once you have entered your Meaning that you basically don't need to do anything to browse the Internet, information. You can also manually choose protocol and the server. Torguard Viscosity, on the other hand, allows for greater customization. Both clients are easy to use and provide a user friendly experience. Still, if you are not familiar with how VPNs work, then you should probably stick to the Lite version. There Is a Great Reason TorGuard is among the hottest and Trusted VPN providers — it's their features that make them excellent. We aren't talking anything crazy here, just the simple stuff that every VPN user needs and desires, but which other VPN service providers somehow do not look at a given. For example, unlimited speed and bandwidth include all TorGuard Bundles. A number of them include unlimited mail storage. You also get a dedicated, fresh IP address just for you. There are more than 3,000 VPN servers available in over 55 countries of the world. They're all strategically distributed across the world so you can be certain that you'll have one close enough wherever your travels might take you. The company was nice enough to put servers in Australia and New Zealand too, the region that has been so unfairly discounted by many VPN suppliers for too long. TorGuard has another intriguing feature that not many other providers Can feature — the server feature that is stealth. The""stealth"" servers are perfect for countries and regions with web control, most notably China. As a result of this characteristic, the residents of these regions can now enjoy the specific same content and access the same sites as anyone else anywhere in the world. TorGuard not only accepts but promotes sharing. But there Are a few things to keep in mind here. There are specific, dedicated servers which should only be used for P2P sharing. This is really pretty smart since you can perform all your P2P sharing on dedicated and especially configured and stored servers while the remaining servers stay free for faster streaming and browsing. There are loads of dedicated servers so that you don't need to worry about slow rates on packed servers. In addition, TorGuard also offers a technical torrent proxy, which supports all major torrent customers (BitTorrent, uTorrent, Deluge, Vuse, and a lot more) and comes with infinite bandwidth. TorgGuard utilizes OpenVPN/SSTP/L2TP/IPsec encryption protocols. You can Choose whichever you prefer, but many experts recommend using OpenVPN for greatest security. You can link as many as five different devices using a single TorGuard account. This should cover all your devices, from computers to smartphones. TorGuard doesn't keep any logs whatsoever so your connections are 100% anonymous. Will Torguard Work With Avast Customer care is just another section where TorGuard does well. Their site has a comprehensive support area with knowledge base, FAQ, troubleshooting, tutorials, forum and a support ticket program. It is also possible to access support from the user accounts area. TorGuard offers the live chat option too. The support staff is friendly, polite and helpful. The support ticket system also works well, with responses coming from a matter of 2 or a moment. Performance and Reliability TorGuard advertises itself as the best VPN service for users Want to remain absolutely anonymous and safe in their online action. In fact, their anonymous proxy support is specifically optimized for p2p filesharing and for bypassing geo restrictions, like watching Netflix or even Hulu in places where those services are either blocked or unavailable. They've 3,000 servers in over 55 countries, including Saudi Arabia and Egypt. Australia is represented, since this area gets ignored which can be nice. They boast switching bandwidth and unlimited speeds, as well As anonymous support for anonymity and privacy, which is remarkable, to say the very least. VPN routers that are pre flashed are also sold by the business. Speed is one of the regions in which TorGuard prevails. When analyzed, the Speeds proved to be quite fast, which range from good to exceptional, very stable and reliable. Exceptional results were achieved through the united kingdom and Netherlands servers, which is frequently the case with other VPN services as well. That you always connect to the server, although Obviously, slower speeds were attracted by linking to more distant servers. We were pleased to see there were No WebRTC or DNS flows at all. Will Torguard Work With Avast VPN Protocols There is more than one way to create an encrypted tunnel Via VPN. My method uses the OpenVPN protocol, which will be famous for being reliable and fast. It, which means you can rest assured that its code was picked over for vulnerabilities. TorGuard clearly believes in giving people options, and it Supports numerous VPN protocols, such as OpenVPN, IKEv2, L2TP, and IPSec. TorGuard also includes Stealth VPN protocols, which utilize SSL VPN in order to prevent an entity. These include OpenVPN Stealth, ShadowSocks, Stunnel, and AnyConnect (also Called OpenConnect). Other companies provide tools to prevent VPN blocking Similar to Stealth VPN, albeit with different names. TunnelBear and Golden Frog VyprVPN offer this attribute, to name two. A TorGuard representative explained that clients can double their Stealth protection by connecting via OpenVPN Stealth or OpenConnect and then use ShadowSocks or Stunnel to conquer deep packet inspection that may be used to obstruct VPN use. Most people probably won't make the most of the, but it's good that TorGuard makes these efforts to make sure its customers can protect their information. You need to trust the VPN you use, because the Firm Behind it may end up with enormous insight in your activities that are internet. That's why when VPNs are reviewed by me, I read the entire privacy policy and talk with all the sellers. In the case of TorGuard, this last part was straightforward. The company gets the smallest privacy policy I have seen, and among the most easy to read. More important, this policy's material is good for consumers. This section says it all:""TorGuard.net does not log or store any traffic or usage from the Virtual Private Network (VPN) or Proxy."" The business admits that it will collect information for billing purposes, but keep in mind that it also enables the usage of anonymous payment procedures. Yet, TorGuard says that it enriches earnings From subscription sales, rather than selling data. The organization's policy isn't to sell or transfer. The exception to this is if the provider believes it's obliged to abide by legal action. That final point is something echoed by VPN companies, Which is why it's important that you know under what legal authority they operate and where these businesses can be found. Some countries have more legislation than many others, after all. The company behind TorGuard is VPNetworks LLC, which can be located in the US. That provider is, in turn, owned by parent firm VPNetworks LTD, LLC, located on the Caribbean island of Nevis. I can't talk to the framework of Nevis, but for its part that the US has no laws requiring the preservation of data. In the past, some VPN businesses used to inject ads into Users' traffic in order to market their users. A representative from TorGuard confirms that the company doesn't utilize this tactic, saying,""It is not something we would even consider."" Will Torguard Work With Avast Click here to subscribe to Torguard today. Servers and Server Locations I look at the amount of servers, While I examine VPNs The company has available. The more servers you will find offered, the more likely you should find one that is not exceptionally crowded, giving you a bigger slice of bandwidth. TorGuard has expanded its host offering, and it Now boasts over 3,000 servers. That puts it up there using Private Internet Access$2.91 at Personal Online Access among the most robust VPN providers I have yet reviewed. NordVPN leads the pack in sheer size encouraging over 5,200 servers. In addition, I look at where these servers are located. The more Geographical selections the more choice you have if you want to spoof your location. A strong geographic distribution also means that you are more likely to find a nearby server when traveling, and also a nearby server ensures lower latency and greater performance. TorGuard currently offers VPN servers in over 53 countries. These are well distributed across Europe, Asia, and the Americas. I am happy to realize that TorGuard has servers in India, and several servers across Africa and the Middle East, since these regions tend to be ignored by other VPN services. Especially, TorGuard also has servers in China, Russia, and Turkey, that are famous for their online policies that are repressive. Hide My Ass dominates with its roster of 286 VPN server places across some 220 countries, however, one of VPN services. CyberGhost$2.75 at CyberGhosthas fewer server locations, but it does offer physical servers in underserved areas such as Africa and South America. Some consumers fear about VPN businesses servers. These are servers that are software defined, which means that a single hardware server can run many virtual servers . These virtual servers can be configured to appear to be than where they're genuinely located. That is an issue if you would like to avoid specific geographic regions, and if you're concerned about where your information is headed. A TorGuard representative told me that the company doesn't use virtual servers, which means you will have no such trouble here. Will Torguard Work With Avast TorGuard Testing In my testing, I installed TorGuard's applications on A Lenovo ThinkPad T460slaptop. The TorGuard customer installed quickly and readily, though It is not a thrill to behold. The program is minimal, appearing somewhat more like a app than something I'd expect on a . You will find none of those adorable bears or the cheeky donkeys from Hide My Ass. It doesn't have a map interface, and it will be a staple of VPN apps. It seems a lot more like the online Access that is Private. Instead of displaying a map or advocating servers for Particular activities, TorGuard just includes a list of servers. That is fine, but it isn't very friendly to new users. Neither are the options on the program's primary window. The typical user is most likely not going to mess with them, but networking pros will no doubt appreciate having these options front and centre. A link at the bottom of the app opens a window filled with options. This app does look like online Access that is Private, it appears to target the kind of power user that is confident. While I am willing to make a Good Deal of allowances for layout, One aspect of TorGuard's Windows program (and, in fact, all of its other apps, too) bothers me. Every other VPN support I have tested will detect which VPN server is nearest or gets the lowest latency. TorGuard doesn't do this. It is a small thing, but changed. TorGuard Provides a Kill Switch list does. TorGuard will quit any applications on this list, if the VPN link be interrupted. It is a security measure. TorGuard's Kill Change is restricted. I discovered that you can add programs which are already running to the list. It also employs the bizarre names you see in the Task Manager, which affords you more control at the cost of usability. NordVPN lets you specify applications that aren't currently running to increase the protected record, which is handy. Other VPN services include specialized servers. NordVPN And ProtonVPN are two which provide servers specifically. TorGuard has a few: stealth servers intended to be almost impossible to be blocked by firewalls. Many streaming services take a dim view of VPNs. That's Because you can use a VPN to spoof your place and get content that's not intended for your geographical region. If you reside in the US but are vacationing in the UK video solutions might block your attempts to VPN back into your house country. While attached to a New York VPN server, I had been Not able to see any content on Netflix. Obviously, which may change at an instant's notice, which is accurate for VPNs that worked with Netflix. Note that section 4.3 of the Netflix terms of service Mentions that it uses technologies to verify your location, which you're only eligible for articles in the region in which you made your account. It does not expressly forbid using a VPN but do not say we didn't warn you if your account gets locked. Beyond VPN TorGuard Delivers a series of services dedicated to anonymity And privacy. In addition to its fundamental VPN service, TorGuard also sells Anonymous Torrent Proxy for $5.95 per month; Anonymous Mail for $6.95 per month; and the Privacy Bundle, which includes both Proxy and VPN support, for $11.95 per month. If you are tempted for the Anonymous Proxy service Rather than the VPN support because it is more affordable, know the proxy was made to filter just BitTorrent traffic, whereas the VPN service protects. If you grabbing a torrent or are currently seeding torrents, the proxy makes sure no one sees your IP address. However, your web browsing and other activity isn't included. It is a case of anonymity sometimes versus all the time. Will Torguard Work With Avast The TorGuard iPhone apphas a striking, Slick appearance. It is not going to win any design awards, but it is far, far better than either the Windows or even Android programs. That said, we think the iPhone program is so easy as to be a bit confusing to use. When we reviewed TorGuardwe noticed that it did not Include our preferred OpenVPN protocol. Instead, the program uses IKEv2. We are also pleased to see that its own iPhone VPN performed well on this stage in our speed tests . We like the TorGuard Android apphas a split Tunneling the majority of the features, as well as feature that you'll see in the Windows app. But, TorGuard drops the ball in style. We find the program feel it will be conducive to new users, and to be perplexing. In our testing, it created an warning upon setup that did not inspire confidence. While the TorGuard service is a great one, it is only outshone by better designed Android VPN programs. Regrettably, the macOS TorGuard program doesn't have the Modicum of panache that found its way into the app. It's not bad; it fine. It's a window to get your VPN started. TorGuard didn't impress me at the time with its speed test Scores on macOS. I look forward to taking another crack. That said, I am pleased to find that it includes OpenVPN. It's among the best macOS VPNs. The Difference Torguard Makes TorGuard has a great deal a Price, a geographically diverse collection of servers, and a collection of subscription add ons to customize your security expertise. Particularly noteworthy is how it aced our rate tests, and also its focus on BitTorrent use two points which are probably associated.

This VPN service does a lot right, and it has a high For doing this, score. It is neck and neck with online Access, not just in terms of what it provides but it offers it. Both are privacy focused, both possess possibilities, and neither has a UI that is terrific. TorGuard, for its part, has the speed but it is beaten by online Access on usability, which is why it takes an Editors' Choice award together with TunnelBear and NordVPN. However, TorGuard is.

There is a VPN, because it can procure an insecure network A vital tool when traveling or using that shifty network at the neighborhood coffee shop. A VPN makes it harder to identify you online by hiding your IP address, which can be used to ascertain your geographical location. Activists and journalists often use VPN solutions to So they can communicate with the external world get around government censors. Most VPNs hang their reputation on being able to unblock blocked sites for these clients. You might use a VPN to spoof your location, so as to watch BBC articles or region locked MLB, for instance.

TorGuard Lite automatically connects the VPN once you've entered your Meaning you essentially don't have to do anything to browse the net, information. It is also possible to manually choose the server and protocol. Torguard Viscosity, on the other hand, allows for greater customization. Both customers are easy to use and provide a user friendly encounter. Still, if you are not familiar with how VPNs work, you should probably stick to the Lite version. There is a good Reason TorGuard is one of the most popular and Trusted VPN services — it has their characteristics which make them excellent. We aren't talking anything crazy here, just the simple things that each VPN user needs and wants, but that other VPN providers do not consider a given. For example, unlimited speed and bandwidth come with all TorGuard Bundles. A number of them even contain infinite mail storage. You also get a dedicated, refreshing IP address only for you. You will find more than 3,000 VPN servers available in more than 55 countries of the world. They're all strategically distributed throughout the globe so you can be certain that you will have one close enough wherever your travels might take you. The business was nice enough to put servers in Australia and New Zealand too, the region that has been so unfairly discounted by many VPN providers for too long. TorGuard has another intriguing feature that not many other providers Can feature — the server attribute that is stealth. The""stealth"" servers are perfect for regions and countries with internet control, most notably China. Thanks to this feature, the residents of these regions can now enjoy the specific same material and get the same sites as anyone else anywhere in the world. TorGuard not only accepts but promotes P2P sharing. However, there Are some things. You will find specific, dedicated servers which should only be used for P2P sharing. This is really pretty smart since you can do all of your P2P sharing on committed and specifically configured and stored servers while the remaining servers stay free for faster streaming and browsing. There are loads of dedicated servers so that you don't need to worry about slow rates on packed servers. In addition, TorGuard also offers a specialized torrent proxy, which supports all major torrent customers (BitTorrent, uTorrent, Deluge, Vuse, and many more) and also comes with infinite bandwidth. TorgGuard utilizes OpenVPN/SSTP/L2TP/IPsec encryption protocols. You can Choose whichever you prefer, but many experts recommend using OpenVPN for maximum security. You can link up to five different apparatus using one TorGuard account. This should cover all your devices, from computers to smartphones. TorGuard does not keep any logs whatsoever so all of your relations are 100% anonymous. Torguard Ssl Vpn Customer support is another section where TorGuard does. Their website has an extensive service region with knowledge base, FAQ, troubleshooting, tutorials, forum and a support ticket program. You can also access support from the consumer account area. TorGuard delivers the chat option too. The service team is polite, helpful and friendly. The service ticket system works with answers coming from a matter of 2 or just a moment. TorGuard advertises itself as the VPN service for Torrent users Want to stay absolutely anonymous and secure. In fact, their anonymous proxy service is especially optimized for p2p filesharing and for bypassing geo restrictions, such as watching Netflix or even Hulu in areas where those services are blocked or unavailable. They have 3,000 servers in over 55 countries, such as Saudi Arabia and Egypt. Australia is represented, which can be nice since this region gets neglected. They boast unlimited speeds and switching bandwidth, as well As anonymous webmail support for anonymity and complete privacy, which is remarkable, to say the very least. VPN routers that are pre flashed are also sold by the company. Speed is just one of the regions in which TorGuard prevails. When analyzed, the Speeds were shown to be quite fast, ranging from good to exceptional, very secure and trustworthy. Exceptional results were achieved through the Netherlands and UK servers, which is frequently the case with other VPN providers . Obviously, by linking to remote servers, slower rates were attracted, but that is why you connect to the nearest server. We were pleased to see that there were No WebRTC or DNS leaks at all. Torguard Ssl Vpn There is more than one way to create an encrypted tunnel Through VPN. My preferred method uses the protocol, which will be known for being reliable and fast. Additionally, it is open source, which means that you may rest assured that its code has been picked over for potential vulnerabilities. TorGuard clearly believes in giving people choices, and it Supports numerous VPN protocols, such as OpenVPN, IKEv2, L2TP, and IPSec. TorGuard also includes Stealth VPN protocols, which utilize SSL VPN in order to prevent an entity. These include OpenVPN Stealth, ShadowSocks, Stunnel, and AnyConnect (also known as OpenConnect). Other companies provide tools to stop VPN blocking Similar to Stealth VPN, albeit with different names. TunnelBear and Golden Frog VyprVPN offer this feature, to mention two. A TorGuard representative told me that clients can double up their Stealth protection by connecting via OpenVPN Stealth or OpenConnect then use ShadowSocks or Stunnel to defeat deep packet inspection which could be used to block VPN use. Most people probably will not take advantage of this, but it's good that TorGuard makes such efforts to ensure its users can protect themselves and their data. You need to trust that the VPN you use, because the company Behind it may end up into your actions that are online. That is why when I examine VPNs, I speak with the vendors and read the entire privacy policy. In the case of TorGuard, this last part was straightforward. The business gets and one of the easiest to read. More important, this policy's material is good for consumers. This section says it all:""TorGuard.net doesn't log or store any traffic or usage from its Virtual Private Network (VPN) or Proxy."" The business admits that it will gather personally identifiable information for billing purposes, but keep in mind that it also enables the usage of anonymous payment methods. Yet, TorGuard States that it only earns revenue From subscription revenue, rather than selling data. The company's policy is not to sell or move the information it has gathered to third parties. The sole exception to this is if the company feels it's obliged to comply with legal action. That final point is something echoed by many VPN companies, Which is why it's important to understand under what legal authority they operate and where these businesses are located. Some nations have more legislation that are privacy friendly than many others. The company behind TorGuard is. That company isalso, in turn, owned by parent firm VPNetworks LTD, LLC, located on the Caribbean island of Nevis. I can't talk to this legal framework of Nevis, but for its role that the US has no laws requiring the preservation of data. Before, some VPN businesses utilized to inject ads into Users' web traffic to be able to monetize their customers. An agent from TorGuard affirms that the company doesn't utilize this tactic, stating,""It's not something we'd even consider."" Torguard Ssl Vpn Click here to sign up to Torguard today.

The Room of Requirement was a crucial element of Harry's Hogwarts experience. It was not just the place where Harry received his first (and final) horcrux but also the place where Voldemort discovered his diadem. The Room of Requirement was so mysterious that it took Dumbledore nearly a whole year to unravel its dark history. The room also houses a variety of odd artifacts, including the Sorting Hat, which is a sapient artifact. It also has a legilimen that uses legitmization to read minds.

It was founded in the 10th century to defend wizards against Muggle persecution. Hogwarts is one of the most famous private boarding schools in Britain. The Forbidden Forest surrounds Hogwarts, also known as the Dark Forest. There are many secrets inside Hogwarts. Some of these secrets are kept from view like the Chamber of Secrets. Others are well known, and frequently used, such as the Leaky Cauldron Restaurant and Gringotts Money Exchange. The Chamber of Secrets was constructed by Salazar Slytherin prior to his departure from Hogwarts. It was designed to cleanse the school of students who were born in the wizarding world. Voldemort believed that he won the final battle and was planning to force all Hogwarts students to Slytherin. He passed away before he could finish his plan. The Chamber of Secrets lies deep beneath Hogwarts school. It also serves as the home to the ancient Basilisk. The Chamber is left open when Dumbledore's army is trampled. It has floor cushions to use defensive spells and Dark Detectors. The Chamber is also the home of an immortal memory of Tom Riddle, who was killed by Harry Potter.

James Joyner · Sunday, January 2, 2022 · 4 comments Washington Post (""Former NFL coach Dan Reeves dies at 77""): Former NFL coach Dan Reeves died Saturday at 77, his family and former teams announced. Reeves, a head coach for 23 seasons with the Denver Broncos, New York Giants and Atlanta Falcons, won 201 games in his NFL coaching career, including the postseason. Teaming with quarterback John Elway, Reeves led the Broncos to three Super Bowl appearances in four years (1987, 1988 and 1990) and then guided the Falcons to Super Bowl XXXIII in 1999, but his teams never won the big game, losing by a combined score of 170 59 in his four appearances. He was a part of nine Super Bowls as a player, head coach and assistant coach, the third most by an individual. Reeves did experience Super Bowl glory as a player and as an assistant coach. He played eight seasons with the Dallas Cowboys as an undrafted running back from 1965 to 1972 and helped the Cowboys win Super Bowl VI before retiring. He was the offensive coordinator for the Cowboys when they won Super Bowl XII. But his first opportunity to be a head coach came with the Broncos in 1981, when he was named the ninth coach in franchise history, making him the youngest head coach in the NFL at the time at 37. Reeves's stint with Denver was his most successful coaching tenure; he led the Broncos to six playoff berths and five AFC West titles in addition to the Super Bowl appearances. He's a member of the Broncos Ring of Fame. ""Reeves coached the Broncos with integrity, character and toughness along with sincere appreciation for his players and coaches,"" the franchise said in a statement, crediting the coach with setting ""the foundation for the Broncos' decade of dominance in the 1980s and championship tradition for years to come."" Over 11 seasons with the Giants and Falcons, he produced three more playoff seasons, including Atlanta's first appearance in the Super Bowl. The Falcons lost, 34 19, to Elway and the Broncos. ""Dan Reeves leaves a lasting legacy in our game as a player and coach. His track record of success in Dallas, Denver, New York and Atlanta over several decades speaks for itself, marking a long and successful life and career in football,"" Falcons owner Arthur Blank said in a statement. ""On behalf of the Atlanta Falcons I extend our condolences to Dan's family and friends as they mourn his passing."" Reeves was twice named coach of the year by the Associated Press (1993 with the Giants and 1998 with the Falcons) and has the ninth most regular season wins among coaches in NFL history (190). Among retired coaches, only Marty Schottenheimer won more games without being enshrined in the Hall of Fame. NYT (""Dan Reeves, Coach Who Reached (but Lost) Four Super Bowls, Dies at 77""): Dan Reeves, a former Dallas Cowboys running back who, as a coach, guided teams to four Super Bowls (although he lost them all), died on Saturday at his home in Atlanta. He was 77. The cause was complications of dementia, according to a family statement. Reeves played and coached with the Dallas Cowboys during a stellar period when they won two Super Bowls, one when he was a player coach and one when he was an offensive coordinator, working for Coach Tom Landry. After several seasons as an assistant to Landry, he was hired as the Broncos' head coach in 1981, replacing Red Miller. Over 12 seasons in Denver, his teams had a record of 110 73 1 and were among the best in the American Football Conference. Led by quarterback John Elway, they lost the Super Bowl in 1987, 1988 and 1990 by wide margins to the New York Giants, the Washington Redskins and the San Francisco 49ers. Reeves clashed with Elway over the Broncos' offensive scheme and disagreed with the team's owner, Pat Bowlen, over control of the team. Reeves fired his offensive coordinator, Mike Shanahan, in early 1992 for insubordination, believing that Shanahan had driven a wedge between him and Elway, who would later say it was ""hell"" playing for Reeves. Following an 8 8 season in 1992, Bowlen fired Reeves. ""When you own a football team,"" Reeves said afterward, ""you should be able to run the ball club the way you would like to."" Bowlen said that he could have renewed Reeves's contract but that within a year ""we both would have been miserable and at each other's throat."" Reeves was hired in early 1993 by the Giants, who had dismissed Ray Handley after a 6 10 season. ""When you've gone and lost three Super Bowls and that's what people will remember the most about you, that's what drives you,"" Reeves said at the news conference where he was introduced. ESPN (""Dan Reeves, former NFL coach and player, dies at 77""): Dan Reeves, who appeared in nine Super Bowls as a player, assistant coach and head coach, died at his home in Atlanta on Saturday. He was 77. Reeves is one of only 10 coaches to have won at least 190 regular season games in his career, and he guided two teams — the Denver Broncos and Atlanta Falcons — to the Super Bowl and was the head coach of the New York Giants for four seasons. With a 201 174 2 NFL coaching record overall, including the postseason, he is one of only nine coaches in NFL history with 200 total wins. His Super Bowl appearances as an individual have been topped only by quarterback Tom Brady and New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick. Dallas Morning News (""Once considered Tom Landry's heir apparent with Cowboys, Dan Reeves found greatness elsewhere""): There was a time many in the NFL assumed Reeves would be Landry's heir apparent. That never unfolded. But he did go on to coach Denver, the New York Giants and Atlanta, accumulate 201 regular season and postseason wins and lead the Broncos and Falcons to the Super Bowl. Reeves would play or coach in nine Super Bowls before his professional career was done. New England's Bill Belichick (12) and Tampa Bay's Tom Brady (10) are the only men with more appearances. Five of those trips — two as a player, three as an assistant coach — came with the Cowboys. His time in Dallas laid the foundation for the success he would enjoy for 23 seasons as one of the league's most respected head coaches. ""I think he knew where his future lay,"" Hall of Fame safety Cliff Harris said. ""It was going to be in coaching. Coach Landry saw that, too. ""He was the motivator and a smart guy that could direct a successful team."" A quarterback with the South Carolina Gamecocks, Reeves signed with the Cowboys as an undrafted rookie free agent in 1965 to play defense and special teams. He was shifted to halfback because of injuries and one year later led the league with 16 touchdowns. A serious knee injury in Week 4 of the '68 season altered his playing career and accelerated his path to coaching. Reeves was a player coach for three seasons before retiring as an active player with 1,990 rushing yards, 1,693 receiving yards and 42 touchdowns. ""If I were going to describe him as a player, he was a smart, technical guy who was a really good athlete that knew the system, knew football, knew how to run and make yardage,"" Harris said. ""The reason he could do that is he was a good athlete and smart. ""He got the Landry system, and Coach Landry knew he got the system."" Reeves would coach the offensive backfield, special teams, receivers and fill the role as the Cowboys offensive coordinator before leaving in '81 to replace Red Miller as Denver's head coach. While I was alive for Reeves' turn as a player with the Dallas Cowboys, he had retired by the time I started rooting for the team in earnest. And while he was the team's offensive coordinator the first few seasons I watched closely the media environment was very different then, so the assistants were nearly invisible. From afar, at least, he always seemed like a good guy and a top notch coach. And he really should be a Hall of Famer. Clark Judge makes the case for Sports Illustrated: Nobody has been in more Super Bowls than Dan Reeves. He played in two. He was an assistant in three. And he was a head coach in four. That should count for something. It should count for Hall of Fame consideration. Yeah, right, you say. So how many times was he the winning head coach? Answer: Zero. His Broncos lost three times, and his Falcons lost once. And big deal. But wait a minute, I hear you protest, doesn't the Pro Football Hall of Fame's board of selectors measure coaches … like quarterbacks …by their rings? In other words, shouldn't that 0 4 record disqualify Reeves from the conversation? Well, yes. Yes, coaches are measured for rings, but, no, Reeves' record doesn't disqualify him from anything but a phone call from the President. Quick, now, tell me how many Lombardi Trophies Marv Levy won? Answer: As many as Dan Reeves. He's 0 4. Yet it didn't keep Levy out of Canton. And what about Bud Grant? He went to four Super Bowls, too, and guess what? He didn't win, either. And he's in the Hall. But, people tell me, Levy's situation was unique because he went to four straight Super Bowls. Not only is that remarkable; it's never been duplicated. And they're right. But look what Reeves accomplished in Denver: He went to three Super Bowls in four years and was the only AFC coach in the 1980s to lead his team to consecutive Super Bowls. Reeves ranks eighth all time in coaching victories with 190. Nine times in his career he won 10 or more games. Three times he won 12 or more. He was 11 9 in the playoffs, won six division titles and was a two time NFL Coach of the Year. Yet he not only can't get into the Hall; he hasn't even been nominated as a finalist. You gotta be kidding. ""Not only Bud Grant and Marv Levy,"" Hall of Fame tight end Shannon Sharpe told the Denver Post, ""but, help me, my Super Bowl memory is a little foggy. What did George Allen win again?"" Uh huh. Zilch. And Allen was 2 5 in the playoffs. ""My biggest regret,"" Reeves once said, ""is that we didn't win a Super Bowl for Denver."" I understand. But that shouldn't preclude him from getting to Canton. Dan Marino didn't win one for Miami, either. And he went to only one. Dan Fouts and Warren Moon didn't. They went to none. But that didn't prevent them from going to the Hall. And it shouldn't prevent Dan Reeves. Oh, and one more thing: Reeves was one helluva player, too. He could run. He could catch. And he could pass, launching the longest completion of the ""Ice Bowl,"" a 50 yard touchdown strike to Lance Rentzel. He could score, too, setting a team record with four TDs in a 1967 game vs. Atlanta, putting up 16 touchdowns in his first year at running back and scoring via the pass, run and catch in a game against Philadelphia. Yeah, I know, that's not supposed to count. You either go into the Hall as a player, or you go in as a coach. Period. To which I say, ""Huh?"" That rule must change, and here's hoping it changes in time for Dan Reeves as good on the field as he was on the sidelines — to make the final cut to 15 so his credentials can be fairly evaluated. In the meantime, his coaching record speaks for itself. He was good enough to resurrect the Denver Broncos and put them in the Super Bowl. Three times, no less. He was good enough to turn around the floundering New York Giants and put them in the playoffs. And he was good enough to rebuild Atlanta and put it in its first … and only … Super Bowl. I've long argued that, given the massive size of NFL rosters, it's absurd to limit inductees to seven a year. It creates travesties like having Drew Pearson, the first team all decade wide receiver for the 1970s, having to wait almost forty years to get his gold jacket. It also means that coaches and players who retire to become television commentators go to the front of the line, because their names remain top of mind. FILED UNDER: Obituaries, Sports Michael Reynolds says: Sunday, 2 January 2022 at 13:15 Dan Reeves from Heaven: Seriously? Not a single comment? Mister Bluster says: When Dan Reeves played for the Dallas Cowboys, the Chicago Bears beat the Cowboys once and the Cowboys beat the Bears once.

Coaching Legend Buddy Ryan Dies At 82 Bart Starr, Winning Quarterback In First Two Super Bowls, Dies At 85","Former NFL player and coach Dan Reeves dies at 77 coach dan dies NFL player Reeves Former NFL player and coach Da ... Former NFL player and head coach Dan Reeves died Saturday at age 77, his family reported. Dan Reeves spent 38 years in the NFL, won a Super Bowl as a player for the Dallas Cowboys, and added another as an assistant to Tom Landry with the same franchise. As head coach, he led the Denver Broncos to three Super Bowls and the Atlanta Falcons to one, although he lost those games. A statement released by his family through former Falcons media relations director Aaron Salkin said Reeves died of complications from dementia. The statement said he died ""in peace and surrounded by his loving family at his home in Atlanta."" ""His legacy will continue through his many friends, players and fans, as well as the rest of the NFL community,"" the family said. Between his passage through the Broncos, 1981 to 1992 and the Falcons, from 1997 to 2003, also led the New York Giants from 1993 to 1996. At just 37 when he took over as coach of the Broncos in 1981, he built a team around the quarterback. John elway who made three appearances in the Super bowl during his 12 years in office. But Denver never won a title under Reeves, being knocked out in his three trips to the title game. Similarly, Reeves has an NFL record of 201 games won, 174 losses and just two draws, and he is one of only seven coaches in NFL history with more than 200 wins. Reeves was a versatile player who played a key role in the Cowboys becoming an NFL powerhouse in the 1960s with Tom Landry, but his own coaching career, spanning three teams and 23 seasons , is where he really made his mark on the league.

Originating in China some 3,500 years ago, only in the last three decades has it become popular in the United States. In 1993, the Food and Drug Administration estimated that Americans made up to 12 million visits per year to acupuncture practitioners and spent upwards of half a billion dollars on acupuncture treatments. Traditional Chinese medicine hold that there are as many as 2,000 acupuncture points on the human body, which are connected by 20 pathways (12 main, 8 secondary) called meridians. These meridians conduct energy, or qi (pronounced ""chi""), between the surface of the body and its internal organs. Each point has a different effect on the qi that passes through it. Qi is believed to help regulate balance in the body. It is influenced by the opposing forces of yin and yang, which represent positive and negative energy and forces in the universe and human body. Acupuncture is believed to keep the balance between yin and yang, thus allowing for the normal flow of qi throughout the body and restoring health to the mind and body. Several theories have been presented as to exactly how acupuncture works. One theory suggests that pain impulses are blocked from reaching the spinal cord or brain at various ""gates"" to these areas. Since a majority of acupuncture points are either connected to (or are located near) neural structures, this suggests that acupuncture stimulates the nervous system. Another theory suggests that acupuncture stimulates the body to produce narcotic like substances called endorphins, which reduce pain. Other studies have found that other pain relieving substances called opiods may be released into the body during acupuncture treatment. Does it hurt? Unlike hypodermic needles, acupuncture needles are solid and hair thin, and they are not designed to cut the skin. They are also inserted to much more shallow levels than hypodermic needles, generally no more than a half inch to an inch depending on the type of treatment being delivered. While each person experiences acupuncture differently, most people feel only a minimal amount of pain as the needles are inserted. Some people reportedly feel a sensation of excitement, while others feel relaxed. If you experience significant pain from the needles, it may be a sign that the procedure is being done improperly. When practiced by a licensed, trained acupuncturist, acupuncture is extremely safe. As a system of health care, acupuncture already has some inherent safeguards. Because the treatment is drug free, patients do not have to worry about taking several doses of a medication or suffering a possible adverse reaction. Properly administered, acupuncture does no harm. However, there are certain conditions you should notify an acupuncturist about before undergoing treatment. If you have a pacemaker, for instance, you should not receive electroacupuncture due to the possibility of electromagnetic interference with the pacemaker. Similarly, if you have a tendency to bleed or bruise easily, or if you are a hemophiliac, you may want to consider a different type of care. What conditions does it treat? In the late 1970s, the World Health Organization recognized the ability of acupuncture and Oriental medicine to treat nearly four dozen common ailments, including neuromusculoskeletal conditions (such as arthritis, neuralgia, insomnia, dizziness, and neck/shoulder pain); emotional and psychological disorders (such as depression and anxiety); circulatory disorders (such as hypertension, angina pectoris, arteriosclerosis and anemia); addictions to alcohol, nicotine and other drugs; respiratory disorders (such as emphysema, sinusitis, allergies and bronchitis); and gastrointestinal conditions (such as food allergies, ulcers, chronic diarrhea, constipation, indigestion, intestinal weakness, anorexia and gastritis). In 1997, a consensus statement released by the National Institutes of Health found that acupuncture could be useful by itself or in combination with other therapies to treat addiction, headaches, menstrual cramps, tennis elbow, fibromyalgia, myofascial pain, osteoarthritis, lower back pain, carpal tunnel syndrome and asthma. Other studies have demonstrated that acupuncture may help in the rehabilitation of stroke patients and can relieve nausea in patients recovering from surgery. What should I expect on my first visit? As with most health practitioners, the first visit to an acupuncturist usually begins with the practitioner taking a detailed history. Since traditional Chinese medicine takes a more holistic approach to patient care than Western medicine, you may be asked questions that appear unimportant (questions about your sleep habits, your ability to tolerate heat or cold, your dietary habits, etc.) but are actually vital to the type of care you will receive. After reviewing your history, the practitioner will begin diagnosing your ailment. Depending on your condition, you may be subjected to an examination of the tongue, as well as an examination of the pulse ­ a major diagnostic technique in traditional Chinese medicine. Using all of the information obtained during the history and diagnosis, the practitioner will then determine the cause of your symptoms. Depending on the condition, needles will be inserted into specific acupuncture points on the body. The acupuncturist may use moxa or electrical stimulation to enhance acupuncture's therapeutic effect. Depending on the seriousness and the length of your condition, your first visit may take between 30 60 minutes. It may take several visits to see significant improvement or cure your condition. As with any treatment plan, however, make sure that your questions are answered completely, and that the treatment plan seems viable and reasonable. If you don't understand a particular technique or type of treatment, make sure to ask.

Acupuncture is believed to keep the balance between yin and yang, thus allowing for the normal flow of qi throughout the body and restoring health to the mind and body. Q: How Does it Work? A: Several theories have been presented as to how acupuncture works. One theory suggests that pain impulses are blocked from reaching the spinal cord or brain at various ""gates"". Since a majority of acupuncture points are either connected to (or are located near) neural structures, this suggests that acupuncture stimulates the nervous system. Another theory suggests that acupuncture stimulates the body to produce narcotic like substances, endorphins, which reduce pain. Other studies have found that other pain relieving substances, opiods, may be released into the body during acupuncture treatment. The general theory of acupuncture is that proper physiological function and health depends on the circulation of nutrients, substances, and energy, called qi, through a network of ""channels"" or ""meridians."" This network connects every organ and part of the body, providing balance, regulation and coordination of physiological processes. Pain and ill health result when the flow of qi through the body is disrupted or blocked by pathogens, trauma, injuries or medications, as well as lifestyle factors such as overwork, poor diet, disturbed emotions, lack of rest or stress.

As a system of health care, acupuncture already has some inherent safeguards. Because the treatment is drug free, patients do not have to worry about taking several doses of a medication or suffering a possible adverse reaction. Properly administered, acupuncture is a safe treatment. Please notify your acupuncturist before treatment if you have a pacemaker, as acupuncture can be performed, but electrical stimulation should not be used. It is also important to notify your acupuncturist if you have a tendency to bleed or bruise easily, if you are a hemophiliac, or if you have any other serious health conditions. Q: Many People Think Acupuncture is Painful… A: Unlike other needles, acupuncture needles are solid and hair thin, and they are not designed to cut the skin. They are inserted to much more shallow levels than hypodermic needles (needles used to give a shot or draw blood), generally no more than a half inch to an inch, depending on the type of treatment being delivered. While each person experiences acupuncture differently, most people feel only a minimal amount of discomfort as the needles pass through the most superficial layers of the skin. Some people report feeling a sensation of excitement, while others feel relaxed. Q: Diagnostic Methods… A: We use Oriental diagnostic methods utilizing the qi and the blood. Qi is yang and blood is yin. Qi is the life force that is believed to flow along a network of meridians in a person's body and is vital to their physical and spiritual health. If you have balanced qi and blood in the body, you do not get diseases. Unfortunately, no one is in perfect balance. With Oriental medicine, we try to balance the qi and blood of the patient in order to achieve homeostasis in the body. Q: What Kind of Diseases can Acupuncture Help? A: In the late 1970s, the World Health Organization recognized the ability of acupuncture and Oriental medicine to treat nearly four dozen common ailments, including neuro musculoskeletal conditions (such as arthritis, neuralgia, insomnia, dizziness, and neck/shoulder pain); emotional and psychological disorders (such as depression and anxiety); circulatory disorders (such as hypertension, angina pectoris, arteriosclerosis and anemia); addictions to alcohol, nicotine and other drugs; respiratory disorders (such as emphysema, sinusitis, allergies and bronchitis); and gastrointestinal conditions (such as food allergies, ulcers, chronic diarrhea, constipation, indigestion, intestinal weakness, anorexia and gastritis). In 1997, a consensus statement released by the National Institutes of Health found that acupuncture could be useful by itself or in combination with other therapies to treat addictions, headaches, menstrual cramps, tennis elbow, fibromyalgia, myofascial pain, osteoarthritis, lower back pain, carpal tunnel syndrome and asthma. Other studies have demonstrated that acupuncture may help in the rehabilitation of stroke patients and can relieve nausea in patients recovering from surgery. As the use of acupuncture increases, more research is being to study the mechanisms and effectiveness of acupuncture on hundreds of different diseases. Q: What is Herbal Medicine? A: Oriental medicine uses natural herbs like plants, roots, and leaves, as well as minerals. There are several types of herbal medicine: Decoction (liquid type), powder, pills or tablets. Decoction involves making a tea out of raw herbs and is the most effective. The others are less labor intensive, but slower to create change in the body. If you get both acupuncture and herbal treatments, you can expect much better results. That's why we strongly recommend herbal medicines to our patients.

A: As with most health practitioners, the first visit to an acupuncturist usually begins with the practitioner taking a detailed history.

As with any treatment plan, make sure that your questions are answered completely, and that the treatment plans seems reasonable. If you don't understand a particular technique or type of treatment, please ask for clarification. Q: How Long Does it Take? A: Usually it takes an hour to two hours for the first visit; after that, it usually takes about an hour. After needling, many patients feel calm and relaxed and fall asleep during the treatment. Q: Do You Accept Insurance? A: Yes. We accept most insurance plans and we are in the ASH (American Specialty Health) network. Please call our clinic and we will be happy to check if your insurance provides acupuncture benefits. Please contact us anytime. We would love to hear from you!

How to Convert Kilometers Per Hour to Kilometers Per Second To convert a kilometer per hour measurement to a kilometer per second measurement, divide the speed by the conversion ratio. One kilometer per second is equal to 3,600 kilometers per hour, so use this simple formula to convert: kilometers per second = kilometers per hour ÷ 3,600 The speed in kilometers per second is equal to the kilometers per hour divided by 3,600. For example, here's how to convert 5,000 kilometers per hour to kilometers per second using the formula above. 5,000 km/h = (5,000 ÷ 3,600) = 1.388889 km/s Kilometers per hour and kilometers per second are both units used to measure speed. Keep reading to learn more about each unit of measure. Kilometers per hour are a measurement of speed expressing the distance traveled in kilometers in one hour. The kilometer per hour, or kilometre per hour, is an SI unit of speed in the metric system. Kilometers per hour can be abbreviated as km/h, and are also sometimes abbreviated as kph. For example, 1 kilometer per hour can be written as 1 km/h or 1 kph. In formal expressions, the slash, or solidus (/), is used to separate units used to indicate division in an expression.[1] Kilometers per hour can be expressed using the formula: vkm/s = dkmthr The velocity in kilometers per hour is equal to the distance in kilometers divided by time in hours. Kilometers per second are a measurement of speed expressing the distance traveled in kilometers in one second. The kilometer per second, or kilometre per second, is an SI unit of speed in the metric system. Kilometers per second can be abbreviated as km/s, and are also sometimes abbreviated as km/sec. For example, 1 kilometer per second can be written as 1 km/s or 1 km/sec. Kilometers per second can be expressed using the formula: vkm/s = dkmtsec The velocity in kilometers per second is equal to the distance in kilometers divided by time in seconds.

Why Does Hentai Have Censoring Typically when a person hears the term hentai, they might wonder what it means. The actual word has numerous various meanings. Often translated as pervert or creep, the Japanese term "" hentai "" refers to manga or anime which depicts gross or unusual pornography. This subgenre is typically connected with severe porn, such as gang rapes and aliens.

It has likewise become a preferred term worldwide of sex and sexuality. Understood for its fetishes and weird acts of sexual relations, hentai works have actually become more popular than sushi and geisha. The term hentai is in fact a mistranslation of the Japanese term hentai seiyoku, which means ' graphic sexual intercourse '. The term was initially used in a fiction work by Meiji Period army doctor Mori Ougai. It was initially utilized to describe an erotica called The Dream of the Fisherman 's Wife. It was attracted 1814 and is extensively considered to be the earliest piece of arm erotica. Throughout the 19th century, shunga erotica was reduced by shoguns. This suggested that the production of such works had to stop. The interest in erotics continued to grow in Japan, especially during the Showa duration. By the end of the 1950s, stories about male homosexuality and cross dressing were the significant fixations in publications. The OVA market, which was a precursor to the video game market, allowed the release of pornographic anime. The Lolita anime series is based upon a serialised manga in the lolicon publication. It was the very first erotic anime to receive an American audience. The term hentai has actually been utilized to specify a variety of sexual anime, manga, and doujinshi.

In Japan, hentai is frequently utilized in colloquial speech to explain unusual kinks. It is also used to describe a particular person, such as a teen boy, or to describe a video game, such as baseball.

A sizeable percentage of the female combat veterans still report neurological symptoms; about two thirds report difficulty remembering new information and trouble concentrating, investigators report in the Journal of Women's Health. An association with more headaches among the combat veterans also was reported and there were ""strong associations"" between deployment status and respiratory symptoms with 39% of combat veterans still reporting difficulty breathing or shortness of breath. More than half also report a low tolerance for heat and cold. ""It's been over 25 years since the war ended and these are very persistent health outcomes,"" says Dr. Steven S. Coughlin, interim chief of the Division of Epidemiology in the Medical College of Georgia Department of Population Health Sciences. ""This tells us that the way the Gulf War illness manifests itself may be different in female than male veterans, so it's important to take gender into account,"" says Coughlin. Twenty years ago, female Gulf War veterans were reporting similar problems, investigators say. The newly reported findings indicate the women are showing increased frequency of symptoms over time and above the rate that would be expected with normal aging, the investigators say. Their reported symptoms correspond with higher rates of diabetes, osteoporosis, thyroid problems, asthma and irritable bowel syndrome in this and similar groups. Additional studies are needed to find biomarkers of Gulf War illness in these former soldiers and effective treatments, they write. ""We think this has a lot of importance for the health of these veterans and hopefully, when combined with information from other studies, it will lead to improved treatment,"" Coughlin says. Three hundred and one female Gulf War veterans from all military branches participated in the study, including 203 who were deployed and 98 who were not sent directly into a war zone. Other persistent problems war zone veterans report include about a third saying they frequently cough when they do not have a cold. Many of their reported symptoms fit the definition of Gulf War illness, which includes having at least three of six symptom categories that include fatigue, neurological/cognitive/mood problems, pain as well as respiratory, gastrointestinal and skin problems. Younger, non white, female Army veterans were likely to report the most symptoms, they say. Their significant symptom burden would likely impact the veterans' quality of life and require medical evaluation and treatment, Coughlin and his colleagues write. ""We are trying to fill in this gap in the published literature about Gulf War illness among women veterans because they have been greatly understudied,"" Coughlin says, referencing the first conflict in which the United States included a sizeable female contingent directly in warfare. The gender differences they are finding are consistent with earlier studies as well as other current ones coming out of Florida based Nova Southeastern University, for example, where they are conducting a clinical trial to try to reverse some of the ill effects, he says. The findings also are more evidence that the female veterans of the Gulf War may have more chronic health issues and conditions than other groups of women generally or female veterans specifically. Coughlin theorizes that females may be more susceptible to some of the wartime hazards because on average their body size is smaller and because of other differences in physiology. ""We can only speculate,"" he adds. When troops started to come home from the Middle East following the conflict that lasted from August 1990 through February 1991, they reported a constellation of symptoms, including headaches, gastrointestinal complaints, skin ailments, forgetfulness, fatigue, particularly after exertion, and musculoskeletal pain, says Coughlin, who served as a senior epidemiologist with the Department of Veterans Affairs Central Office in Washington, D.C. The leading theory early on was that it was a psychogenic illness, somewhat similar to the PTSD experienced by many Vietnam War veterans. Now the consensus is that much of it results from the neurological impact of neurotoxins soldiers on the frontline were exposed to, Coughlin says. ""They were inundated with pesticides, there are a lot of biting flies and pests in that part of the world so they had uniforms infused with pesticides, a lot of them even wore a dog's flea collar for extra protection,"" he says. Soldiers also were asked to take pyridostigmine bromide, a drug given to patients with myasthenia gravis to improve muscle strength, prophylactically to help protect them from nerve agents in field, but the drug itself is mildly toxic to nerves and there is some evidence that, in combination with some of the insecticides used, it becomes more potent. ""Every time the alarms went off, they would have to take these little white pills,"" Coughlin says. There were other environmental toxins as well, like blown up munitions factories and low dose exposure to sarin nerve gas and others. ""It's similar to what you see among agricultural workers exposed to pesticides,"" he notes. The veterans also were exposed to hazards such as smoke from oil well fires and burn pits used to incinerate waste, the investigators write. The new study looked at the frequency and patterns of health symptoms in the female veterans as well as military service and lifestyle. The investigators theorized that symptoms associated with Gulf War illness would be more prominent in the women who saw conflict. They found the deployed veterans were significantly more likely to report seven symptoms consistent with Gulf War illness, including low tolerance for heat or cold, difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, frequent coughing without having a cold, difficulty concentrating and remembering recent information, feeling down or depressed and anxious, the investigators write. Those deployed were more than twice as likely to report more total symptoms and nonwhites—including American Indians, Alaska natives as well as Asian Americans and Pacific Islands Americans—were four times more likely to report symptoms than whites. Older women were less likely than younger women to report symptoms and those enlisted in the Air Force and Navy were significantly less likely to report more symptoms than those in the Army. Participants in the study were a mean age of early 50s and other demographics, like race, ethnicity and education, were similar, but those who saw combat were more likely to have served in the Army or Navy and less likely to have served in the Air Force. They were taken from a national cohort of 1,318 Gulf War veterans created from the Veterans Affairs Cooperative Studies Program 585 Gulf War Era Cohort and Biorepository pilot study. Outcomes of female veterans in the group have not been reported separately. Women comprised 7% of the 700,000 military personnel to serve in the Gulf War, the largest number of women to serve in a war zone in U.S. military history at that time. The influx of the some 50,000 female Gulf War veterans resulted in the establishment of specialty clinics for them at VA hospitals. Evidence indicates about 19% of women veterans still have delayed or unmet health care needs, possibly because of expanded military roles for women, including increased exposure to combat, the investigators write.

The Justice Department and several states sued Google on Tuesday, Jan. 24, 2023, alleging that its dominance in digital advertising harms competition. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File) By ERIC TUCKER, BARBARA ORTUTAY and FRANK BAJAK (Associated Press) WASHINGTON — The Justice Department and eight states filed an antitrust suit against Google on Tuesday, seeking to shatter its alleged monopoly on the entire ecosystem of online advertising as a hurtful burden to advertisers, consumers and even the U.S. government. The government alleges that Google's plan to assert dominance in online ads has been to ""neutralize or eliminate"" rivals through acquisitions and to force advertisers to use its products by making it difficult to use competitors' offerings. It's part of a new, if slow and halting, push by the U.S. to rein in big tech companies that have enjoyed largely unbridled growth in the past decade and a half. The antitrust suit was filed in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia. Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a press conference Tuesday that ""for 15 years, Google has pursued a course of anti competitive conduct"" that has halted the rise of rival technologies and manipulated the mechanics of online ad auctions to force advertisers and publishers to use its tools. In so doing, he added, ""Google has engaged in exclusionary conduct"" that has ""severely weakened,"" if not destroyed, competition in the ad tech industry. ""First, Google controls the technology used by nearly every major website publisher to offer advertising space for sale. Second, Google controls the leading tool used by advertisers to buy that advertising space. And third, Google controls the largest ad exchange that matches publishers and advertisers together each time that ad space is sold,"" Garland said. As a result, he added, ""website creators earn less and advertisers pay more."" And this means fewer publishers can offer their content without subscriptions, paywalls and other fees to make up for revenue. The department's suit accuses Google of unlawfully monopolizing the way ads are served online by excluding competitors. This includes its 2008 acquisition of DoubleClick, a dominant ad server, and subsequent rollout of technology that locks in the split second bidding process for ads that get served on web pages. Google's ad manager lets large publishers who have significant direct sales manage their advertisements. The ad exchange, meanwhile, is a real time marketplace to buy and sell online display ads. The lawsuit demands that Google break off three different businesses from its core business of search, YouTube and other products such as Gmail: the buying and selling of ads and ownership of the exchange where that business is transacted. Digital ads currently account for about 80% of Google's revenue, and by and large support its other, less lucrative endeavors. But the company, along with Facebook's parent company Meta, has seen its market share decline in recent years as smaller rivals grab bigger portions of the online advertising market. On top of that, the overall online ads environment market is cooling off as advertisers clamp down on spending and brace for a potential recession. Alphabet Inc., Google's parent company, said in a statement that the suit ""doubles down on a flawed argument that would slow innovation, raise advertising fees, and make it harder for thousands of small businesses and publishers to grow."" Tuesday's lawsuit comes as the U.S. government is increasingly looking to rein in Big Tech's dominance, although such legal action can take years to complete and Congress has not passed any recent legislation seeking to curb the influence of the tech industry's largest players. The European Union has been more active. It launched an antitrust investigation into Google's digital ad dominance in 2021. British and European regulators are also looking into whether an agreement for online display advertising services between Google and Meta breached rules on fair competition. An internet services trade group that includes Google as a member described the lawsuit and its ""radical structural remedies"" as unjustified. Matt Schruers, president of the Computer & Communications Industry Association, said competition for advertising is fierce and the ""governments' contention that digital ads aren't in competition with print, broadcast, and outdoor advertising defies reason."" Dina Srinivasan, a Yale University fellow and adtech expert, said the lawsuit is ""huge"" because it aligns the entire nation — state and federal governments — in a bipartisan legal offensive against Google. The current online ad market, Srinivasan said, ""is broken and totally inefficient."" The fact that intermediaries are getting 30% to 50% of the take on each ad trade is ""an insane inefficiency to have baked into the U.S. economy."" She called it ""a massive tax on the free internet and consumers at large. It directly affects the viability of a free press"" as well. As with many highly complex technical markets, it has taken time for federal and state regulators and policymakers to catch up with and understand the online ad market. Srinivasan noted that it took a decade before they woke up to the perils of high speed trading in financial markets and began adopting measures to discourage it. Google held nearly 29% of the U.S. digital advertising market — which includes all the ads people see on computers. phones, tablets and other internet connected devices — in 2022, according to research firm Insider Intelligence. Facebook parent company Meta is second, commanding nearly 20% of the market. Amazon is a distant, but growing, third at more than 11%. Insider is estimating that both Google and Meta's share of the ad market will decline, while rivals such as Amazon and TikTok are expected to see gains. This is the latest legal action taken against Google by either the Justice Department or local state governments. In October 2020, for instance, the Trump administration and 11 state attorneys general sued Google for violating antitrust laws, alleging anticompetitive practices in the search and search advertising markets. Asked why the Justice Department would bring the suit when a similar complaint has already been filed by states, Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter, the department's top antitrust official, said, ""We conducted our own investigation, and that investigation occurred over many years."" He said the Justice Department lawsuit, totaling roughly 150 pages, details ""many facts, many episodes that individually and in the aggregate"" reveal numerous monopolies. Tuesday's lawsuit in essence aligns the Biden administration and new states with the 35 states and District of Colombia that sued Google in December 2020 over the exact same issues. The states taking part in the suit include California, Virginia, Connecticut, Colorado, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island and Tennessee.

The Justice Department and several states have sued Google, alleging that its dominance in digital advertising harms competition. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster) WASHINGTON The Justice Department and eight states filed an antitrust suit against Google on Tuesday, seeking to shatter its alleged monopoly on the entire ecosystem of online advertising as a hurtful burden to advertisers, consumers and even the U.S. government. The government alleged in the complaint that Google is looking to ""neutralize or eliminate"" rivals in the online ad marketplace through acquisitions and to force advertisers to use its products by making it difficult to use competitors' offerings. It's part of a new, if slow and halting, push by the U.S. to rein in big tech companies that have enjoyed largely unbridled growth in the past decade and a half. Tuesday's lawsuit comes as the U.S. government is increasingly looking to rein in Big Tech's dominance, although such legal action can take years to complete and Congress has not passed any recent legislation seeking to curb the influence of the tech industry's largest players. The European Union has been more active. It launched an antitrust investigation into Google's digital ad dominance in 2021. British and European regulators are also looking into whether an agreement for online display advertising services between Google and Meta breached rules on fair competition. This lawsuit seeks to apply to the digital ad market the same rules that apply to the financial markets, she said. Brokers, banks and other companies that have sometimes competing interests aren't permitted to own the New York Stock Exchange. But that's not the lawsuit's concern. It is focused on the technical market mechanisms that Google controls, including the ad server it developed building on the 2008 purchase of market dominating DoubleClick. DOJ says Google has a more than 90% share of the business that serves ads to websites and controls about 80% of the ""buy side"" Google Ads network where advertisers compete to place ads. The states taking part in Tuesday's suit include California, Virginia, Connecticut, Colorado, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island and Tennessee.

Authorities said the cause of death was being investigated. Hours earlier, a Spanish court issued a preliminary ruling in favor of the 75 year old tycoon's extradition to the United States to face tax related criminal charges that could carry decades in prison. Security personnel at the Brians 2 penitentiary near the northeastern Spanish city tried to revive him, but the jail's medical team finally certified his death, a statement from the regional Catalan government said. ""A judicial delegation has arrived to investigate the causes of death,"" the statement said, adding that ""Everything points to death by suicide."" The statement didn't identify McAfee by name, but said he was a 75 year old U.S. citizen awaiting extradition to his country. A Catalan government source familiar with the event who was not authorized to be named in media reports confirmed to the AP that the dead man was McAfee. Spain's National Court on Monday ruled in favor of extraditing McAfee, who had argued in a hearing earlier this month that the charges against him by prosecutors in Tennessee were politically motivated and that he would spend the rest of his life in prison if he was returned to the U.S. The court's ruling was made public on Wednesday and was open for appeal. Any final extradition order would also need to get approval from the Spanish Cabinet. Tennessee prosecutors charged 75 year old McAfee with evading taxes after failing to report income made from promoting cryptocurrencies while he did consultancy work, as well as income from speaking engagements and selling the rights to his life story for a documentary. The entrepreneur was arrested last October at Barcelona's international airport. A judge ordered at that time that McAfee should be held in jail while awaiting the outcome of a hearing on extradition. McAfee led an eccentric life after he sold his stake in the antivirus software company named after him in the early 1990s. He twice ran long shot bids for U.S. president and was a participant in Libertarian Party presidential debates in 2016. In July 2019, McAfee was released from detention in the Dominican Republic after he and five others were suspected of traveling on a yacht carrying high caliber weapons, ammunition and military style gear, officials on the Caribbean island said at the time. McAfee was charged last October in Tennessee with evading taxes after failing to report income made from promoting cryptocurrencies while he did consulting work, made speaking engagements and sold the rights to his life story for a documentary. The criminal charges carry a prison sentence of up to 30 years. The last post from McAfee's Twitter account was a retweet of a Father's Day message from his wife Janice McAfee. ""These eight months John has spent in prison in Spain have been especially hard on his overall health both mentally and physically, as well as financially, but he is undeterred from continuing to speak truth to power,"" it said. The U.S. embassy in Madrid didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.

The developer of a worldwide famous computer antivirus software John McAfee was found dead in his Spanish prison cell Wednesday, just hours after his extradition to the United States had been approved. Preliminary reports indicate McAfee might have committed suicide. He was found lifeless at a penitentiary facility near Barcelona where he was being held pending extradition ""at around 7:00 p.m. local time,"" a spokeswoman for the Catalonia correctional service was quoted as saying. The 75 year old McAfee was wanted in his native United States for tax fraud. After making his fortune with his antivirus in the 1980s, McAfee became a cryptocurrency guru and was followed by close to a million people on Twitter. He was arrested in October 2020 at the Barcelona airport after the publication by a US attorney of an indictment against him for failing to declare millions of dollars from the promotion of cryptocurrencies, consulting services, conferences and copyright royalties for a documentary about his life. The US authorities had issued an arrest warrant to Interpol for allegedly pocketing more than 13 million dollars through fraudulent schemes on the internet and together with a close aide they were both being investigated for seven possible crimes of conspiracy to commit stock fraud and money laundering. Earlier Wednesday, Spain's National High Court had given the green light for his extradition. During his Spanish court appearance, he claimed to have paid ""millions of dollars in taxes"" and said he was the victim of political persecution for having denounced corruption. McAfee's tax debt in the United States is said to amount to more than four million dollars. In 1989 he founded McAfee Associates, which for a few years called itself Network Associates and which eventually became the McAfee company. In 2010 he launched a new project focused on biosecurity at the helm of the Belize based company QuorumEx. Categories: Politics, International, United States.

(AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster) WASHINGTON The Justice Department and eight states filed an antitrust suit against Google on Tuesday, seeking to shatter its alleged monopoly on the entire ecosystem of online advertising as a hurtful burden to advertisers, consumers and even the U.S. government. The government alleged in the complaint that Google is looking to ""neutralize or eliminate"" rivals in the online ad marketplace through acquisitions and to force advertisers to use its products by making it difficult to use competitors' offerings. It's part of a new, if slow and halting, push by the U.S. to rein in big tech companies that have enjoyed largely unbridled growth in the past decade and a half.

This lawsuit seeks to apply to the digital ad market the same rules that apply to the financial markets, she said. Brokers, banks and other companies that have sometimes competing interests aren't permitted to own the New York Stock Exchange. But that's not the lawsuit's concern. It is focused on the technical market mechanisms that Google controls, including the ad server it developed building on the 2008 purchase of market dominating DoubleClick. DOJ says Google has a more than 90% share of the business that serves ads to websites and controls about 80% of the ""buy side"" Google Ads network where advertisers compete to place ads. The states taking part in Tuesday's suit include California, Virginia, Connecticut, Colorado, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island and Tennessee.

The Justice Department and several states sued Google on Tuesday, Jan. 24, 2023, alleging that its dominance in digital advertising harms competition. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File) By ERIC TUCKER, BARBARA ORTUTAY and FRANK BAJAK (Associated Press) WASHINGTON — The Justice Department and eight states filed an antitrust suit against Google on Tuesday, seeking to shatter its alleged monopoly on the entire ecosystem of online advertising as a hurtful burden to advertisers, consumers and even the U.S. government. The government alleges that Google's plan to assert dominance in online ads has been to ""neutralize or eliminate"" rivals through acquisitions and to force advertisers to use its products by making it difficult to use competitors' offerings. It's part of a new, if slow and halting, push by the U.S. to rein in big tech companies that have enjoyed largely unbridled growth in the past decade and a half. The antitrust suit was filed in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia. Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a press conference Tuesday that ""for 15 years, Google has pursued a course of anti competitive conduct"" that has halted the rise of rival technologies and manipulated the mechanics of online ad auctions to force advertisers and publishers to use its tools. In so doing, he added, ""Google has engaged in exclusionary conduct"" that has ""severely weakened,"" if not destroyed, competition in the ad tech industry. ""First, Google controls the technology used by nearly every major website publisher to offer advertising space for sale. Second, Google controls the leading tool used by advertisers to buy that advertising space. And third, Google controls the largest ad exchange that matches publishers and advertisers together each time that ad space is sold,"" Garland said. As a result, he added, ""website creators earn less and advertisers pay more."" And this means fewer publishers can offer their content without subscriptions, paywalls and other fees to make up for revenue. The department's suit accuses Google of unlawfully monopolizing the way ads are served online by excluding competitors. This includes its 2008 acquisition of DoubleClick, a dominant ad server, and subsequent rollout of technology that locks in the split second bidding process for ads that get served on web pages. Google's ad manager lets large publishers who have significant direct sales manage their advertisements. The ad exchange, meanwhile, is a real time marketplace to buy and sell online display ads. The lawsuit demands that Google break off three different businesses from its core business of search, YouTube and other products such as Gmail: the buying and selling of ads and ownership of the exchange where that business is transacted. Digital ads currently account for about 80% of Google's revenue, and by and large support its other, less lucrative endeavors. But the company, along with Facebook's parent company Meta, has seen its market share decline in recent years as smaller rivals grab bigger portions of the online advertising market. On top of that, the overall online ads environment market is cooling off as advertisers clamp down on spending and brace for a potential recession. Alphabet Inc., Google's parent company, said in a statement that the suit ""doubles down on a flawed argument that would slow innovation, raise advertising fees, and make it harder for thousands of small businesses and publishers to grow."" Tuesday's lawsuit comes as the U.S. government is increasingly looking to rein in Big Tech's dominance, although such legal action can take years to complete and Congress has not passed any recent legislation seeking to curb the influence of the tech industry's largest players. The European Union has been more active. It launched an antitrust investigation into Google's digital ad dominance in 2021. British and European regulators are also looking into whether an agreement for online display advertising services between Google and Meta breached rules on fair competition. An internet services trade group that includes Google as a member described the lawsuit and its ""radical structural remedies"" as unjustified. Matt Schruers, president of the Computer & Communications Industry Association, said competition for advertising is fierce and the ""governments' contention that digital ads aren't in competition with print, broadcast, and outdoor advertising defies reason."" Dina Srinivasan, a Yale University fellow and adtech expert, said the lawsuit is ""huge"" because it aligns the entire nation — state and federal governments — in a bipartisan legal offensive against Google. The current online ad market, Srinivasan said, ""is broken and totally inefficient."" The fact that intermediaries are getting 30% to 50% of the take on each ad trade is ""an insane inefficiency to have baked into the U.S. economy."" She called it ""a massive tax on the free internet and consumers at large. It directly affects the viability of a free press"" as well. As with many highly complex technical markets, it has taken time for federal and state regulators and policymakers to catch up with and understand the online ad market. Srinivasan noted that it took a decade before they woke up to the perils of high speed trading in financial markets and began adopting measures to discourage it. Google held nearly 29% of the U.S. digital advertising market — which includes all the ads people see on computers. phones, tablets and other internet connected devices — in 2022, according to research firm Insider Intelligence. Facebook parent company Meta is second, commanding nearly 20% of the market. Amazon is a distant, but growing, third at more than 11%. Insider is estimating that both Google and Meta's share of the ad market will decline, while rivals such as Amazon and TikTok are expected to see gains. This is the latest legal action taken against Google by either the Justice Department or local state governments. In October 2020, for instance, the Trump administration and 11 state attorneys general sued Google for violating antitrust laws, alleging anticompetitive practices in the search and search advertising markets. Asked why the Justice Department would bring the suit when a similar complaint has already been filed by states, Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter, the department's top antitrust official, said, ""We conducted our own investigation, and that investigation occurred over many years."" He said the Justice Department lawsuit, totaling roughly 150 pages, details ""many facts, many episodes that individually and in the aggregate"" reveal numerous monopolies. Tuesday's lawsuit in essence aligns the Biden administration and new states with the 35 states and District of Colombia that sued Google in December 2020 over the exact same issues. The states taking part in the suit include California, Virginia, Connecticut, Colorado, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island and Tennessee.

The order of months in the Roman calendar has been January to December since King Numa Pompilius in about 700 BC, according to Plutarch and Macrobius. However, Roman writers identified years by naming the year's consuls, who did not enter office on 1 January until 153 BC. Since then 1 January has been the first day of the year, except during the Middle Ages when several other days were the first (1 March, 25 March, Easter, 1 September, 25 December). With the expansion of Western culture to the rest of the world during the twentieth century, the 1 January date became global, even in countries with their own New Year celebrations on other days (e.g., China and India). At present, the celebration of the New Year is a major event worldwide. Many large scale events are held in major cities around the world, with many large fireworks events on New Year's Eve (31 December). Sydney launched over 80,000 fireworks at midnight, and had more than one and a half million attendees; it was also the most watched event on television worldwide last year. In Valparaiso upwards of two million visitors witnessed the largest fireworks display in a natural setting; a total of more than 21 kilometers of fireworks on the bay, from the commercial port city of Valparaiso to Concon, Chile, all in 25 minutes of entertainment. London's New Year celebrations centre around the London Eye, with an impressive fireworks display while Big Ben strikes midnight. In New York, the celebration is focused around a large crystal ball that descends in a one minute countdown in Times Square. Edinburgh plays host to one of the world's largest Hogmanay events. The celebrations last for four days and attract visitors from around the globe to take part in street parties and attend concerts. In the culture of Latin America there are a variety of traditions and superstitions surrounding these dates as omens for the coming year. January remains a symbol of the New Year's celebration. According to the Christian tradition, 1 January coincides with the circumcision of Christ (eight days after birth), when the name of Jesus was given to him (Luke 2: 21). 7 January Orthodox Christmas Christmas or Christmas Day is an annual Christian holiday commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ. It is celebrated on December 25, but this date is not known to be Jesus' actual birthday, and may have initially been chosen to correspond with either the day exactly nine months after some early Christians believed Jesus had been conceived, a historical Roman festival, or the date of the northern hemisphere's winter solstice. Christmas is central to the Christmas and holiday season, and in Christianity marks the beginning of the larger season of Christmastide, which lasts twelve days 19 January Baptism Day of our Lord Jesus Christ (ნათლისღება, Nathlisgheba) Usually called the Feast of Theophany (Greek: Θεοφάνεια, ""God shining forth"" or ""divine manifestation""), it is one of the Great Feasts of the liturgical year, being third in rank, behind only Pascha (Easter) and Pentecost in importance. It is celebrated on January 6 of the calendar that the particular Church uses. On the Julian Calendar, which some of the Orthodox churches follow, that date corresponds, during the present century, to January 19 on the Gregorian or Revised Julian calendar. Today in Eastern Orthodox churches, the emphasis at this feast is on the shining forth and revelation of Jesus Christ as the Messiah and Second Person of the Trinity at the time of his baptism. It is also celebrated because, according to tradition, the baptism of Jesus in the Jordan River by St. John the Baptist marked one of only two occasions when all three Persons of the Trinity manifested themselves simultaneously to humanity: God the Father by speaking through the clouds, God the Son being baptized in the river, and God the Holy Spirit in the shape of a dove descending from heaven (the other occasion was the Transfiguration on Mount Tabor). Thus the holy day is considered to be a Trinitarian feast. 3 March Mother's Day (დედის დღე, Dedis dghe) 8 March International Women's Day (ქალთა საერთაშორისო დღე, Kalta saertachoriso dghe) International Women's Day (IWD) is marked on March 8 every year. It is a major day of global celebration for the economic, political and social achievements of women. Started as a political event, the holiday blended in the culture of many countries (primarily Russia and the countries of former Soviet bloc). In some celebrations, the day lost its political flavour, and became simply an occasion for men to express their love to the women around them in a way somewhat similar to Mother's Day and St Valentine's Day mixed together. In others, however, the political and human rights theme as designated by the United Nations runs strong, and political and social awareness of the struggles of women worldwide are brought out and examined in a hopeful manner. 9 April Day of National Unity (ეროვნული ერთიანობის დღე, Erovnouli ertianobis dghe) Commemoration of the April 9 tragedy 1989(also known as Tbilisi Massacre, Tbilisi tragedy) when on Rustaveli Avenue, in Tbilisi an anti Soviet demonstration was dispersed by the Soviet Army, resulting in 20 deaths and hundreds of injuries. 3 May Orthodox Easter Monday (აღდგომა, Aghdgoma) Easter (Greek: Πάσχα) is the most important annual religious feast in the Christian liturgical year. According to Christian scripture, Jesus was resurrected from the dead on the third day of his crucifixion. Christians celebrate this resurrection on Easter Day or Easter Sunday (also Resurrection Day or Resurrection Sunday), two days after Good Friday and three days after Maundy Thursday. The chronology of his death and resurrection is variously interpreted to be between AD 26 and AD 36. Easter also refers to the season of the church year called Eastertide or the Easter Season. Traditionally the Easter Season lasted for the forty days from Easter Day until Ascension Day but now officially lasts for the fifty days until Pentecost. The first week of the Easter Season is known as Easter Week or the Octave of Easter. Easter also marks the end of Lent, a season of fasting, prayer, and penance. Easter is a moveable feast, meaning it is not fixed in relation to the civil calendar. The First Council of Nicaea (325) established the date of Easter as the first Sunday after the full moon (the Paschal Full Moon) following the vernal equinox. Ecclesiastically, the equinox is reckoned to be on March 21. The date of Easter therefore varies between March 22 and April 25. Eastern Christianity bases its calculations on the Julian Calendar whose March 21 corresponds, during the twenty first century, to April 3 in the Gregorian Calendar, in which calendar their celebration of Easter therefore varies between April 4 and May 8. Easter is linked to the Jewish Passover not only for much of its symbolism but also for its position in the calendar. Relatively newer elements such as the Easter Bunny and Easter egg hunts have become part of the holiday's modern celebrations, and those aspects are often celebrated by many Christians and non Christians alike. 9 May Victory Day (ფაშიზმზე გამარჯვების დღე, Phachizmze gamardjvebis dghe) 12 May Saint Andrea the First Day (წმინდა მოციქულის ანდრია პირველწოდებულის საქართველოში შემოსვლის დღე, Ts'minda motsiqhoulis andreys pirvelts'odeboulis sakartvelochi chemosvla dghe) Celebration of day of Apostle Andrew the 'first called', founder of Georgian Orthodox Church. 26 May Independence Day (დამოუკიდებლობის დღე, Damouk'ideblobis dghe) On May 26, 1918 National Council of Georgia declared national independence of Georgian people and creation of Democratic Republic of Georgia. The statehood of Georgia was restored after 117 years (from 1801) 28 August Assumption of Mary (მარიამობა, Mariamoba) According to the belief of Christians of the Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox, and Oriental Orthodox churches and by some Anglicans, the Assumption of Mary was the bodily taking up of the Virgin Mary into Heaven at the end of her life. The Catholic Church teaches as dogma that Mary, ""having completed the course of her earthly life, was assumed body and soul into heavenly glory."" This doctrine was dogmatically and infallibly defined by Pope Pius XII on November 1, 1950, in his Apostolic Constitution Munificentissimus Deus. This belief is known as the Dormition by the Orthodox. In the churches which observe it, the Assumption is a major festival, commonly celebrated on August 15. In many countries it is a Catholic Holy Day of Obligation. In his August 15, 2004, homily given at Lourdes, Pope John Paul II quoted John 14:3 as one of the scriptural bases for understanding the dogma of the Assumption of Mary. In this verse, Jesus tells his disciples at the Last Supper, ""If I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and will receive you to myself; that where I am, you may be there also."" According to Catholic theology, Mary is the pledge of the fulfillment of Christ's promise. 14 October Day of Svetitskhoveli Cathedral (in Mtskheta) (სვეტიცხოვლობა, Svetistskhovloba) Celebration of the cathedral in the centre of Mtskheta one of the sacred places of Georgia, it was erected in the 11th c by the architect Arsukidze in the place where the first Christian church in Georgia stood in the 4th c. The robe of Jesus Christ is buried within the cathedral 23 November Saint George's Day (გიორგობა, Guiorgoba) Saint George (in Georgian: წმინდა გიორგი, ''tsminda giorgi'') is a patron saint of Georgia.

The holiday is observed during Holy Week as part of the Paschal Triduum on the Friday preceding Easter Sunday, and often coincides with the Jewish observance of Passover. Based on the scriptural details of the Sanhedrin Trial of Jesus, the Crucifixion of Jesus was most probably on a Friday. The estimated year of Good Friday is AD 33, by two different groups, and originally as AD 34 by Isaac Newton via the differences between the Biblical and Julian calendars and the crescent of the moon. A third method, using a completely different astronomical approach based on a lunar Crucifixion darkness and eclipse model (consistent with Apostle Peter's reference to a ""moon of blood"" in Acts 2:20) arrives at the same date, namely Friday April 3, AD 33. 20 April Orthodox Easter Monday Easter (Greek: Πάσχα) is the most important annual religious feast in the Christian liturgical year.

From correspondence a version appears to have been distributed in 1513, using a Latin title, De Principatibus (About Principalities).

This was done with the permission of the Medici pope Clement VII, but ""long before then, in fact since the first appearance of the Prince in manuscript, controversy had swirled about his writings."" Although it was written as if it were a traditional work in the mirrors for princes style, it is generally agreed that it was especially innovative. This is only partly because it was written in the vernacular Italian rather than Latin, a practice which had become increasingly popular since the publication of Dante s Divine Comedy and other works of Renaissance literature. The Prince is sometimes claimed to be one of the first works of modern philosophy, especially modern political philosophy, in which the effective truth is taken to be more important than any abstract ideal. It was also in direct conflict with the dominant Catholic and scholastic doctrines of the time concerning how to consider politics and ethics. Although it is relatively short, the treatise is the most remembered of Machiavelli s works and the one most responsible for bringing the word ""Machiavellian"" into usage as a pejorative. It also helped make ""Old Nick"" an English term for the devil, and even contributed to the modern negative connotations of the words ""politics"" and ""politician"" in western countries. In terms of subject matter it overlaps with the much longer Discourses on Livy, which was written a few years later.

We here in The VPN Laboratory agree it is one of the top 10 VPN providers available. Servers run in 50 states and supplies great VPN support. Torguard Ssl Vpn Click here to subscribe to Torguard today. A VPN creates an encrypted tunnel between your computer And a VPN. Your internet traffic travels through that tunnel, meaning that anyone snooping around, even on precisely the exact same network as you, won't find something. A VPN can also help safeguard your privacy, today that ISPs can market your data. ISPs have insight but not if you use a VPN. There is a VPN, because it can procure an insecure network A vital tool when traveling or using that shifty network at the neighborhood coffee shop. A VPN makes it harder to identify you online by hiding your IP address, which can be used to ascertain your geographical location. Activists and journalists often use VPN solutions to So they can communicate with the external world get around government censors. Most VPNs hang their reputation on being able to unblock blocked sites for these clients. You might use a VPN to spoof your location, so as to watch BBC articles or region locked MLB, for instance. Be aware that Netflix is currently working to block VPN. Torguard Ssl Vpn To Start using TorGuard, simply download the Suitable program for your Operating system and follow the setup manual. You can pick between TorGuard Lite and Torguard Viscosity. The very first one is a simpler client software, ideal for first time VPN users, whereas the latter is a better option for tech savvy users. TorGuard Lite automatically connects the VPN once you've entered your Meaning you essentially don't have to do anything to browse the net, information. It is also possible to manually choose the server and protocol. Torguard Viscosity, on the other hand, allows for greater customization. Both customers are easy to use and provide a user friendly encounter. Still, if you are not familiar with how VPNs work, you should probably stick to the Lite version. There is a good Reason TorGuard is one of the most popular and Trusted VPN services — it has their characteristics which make them excellent. We aren't talking anything crazy here, just the simple things that each VPN user needs and wants, but that other VPN providers do not consider a given. For example, unlimited speed and bandwidth come with all TorGuard Bundles. A number of them even contain infinite mail storage. You also get a dedicated, refreshing IP address only for you. You will find more than 3,000 VPN servers available in more than 55 countries of the world. They're all strategically distributed throughout the globe so you can be certain that you will have one close enough wherever your travels might take you. The business was nice enough to put servers in Australia and New Zealand too, the region that has been so unfairly discounted by many VPN providers for too long. TorGuard has another intriguing feature that not many other providers Can feature — the server attribute that is stealth. The""stealth"" servers are perfect for regions and countries with internet control, most notably China. Thanks to this feature, the residents of these regions can now enjoy the specific same material and get the same sites as anyone else anywhere in the world. TorGuard not only accepts but promotes P2P sharing. However, there Are some things. You will find specific, dedicated servers which should only be used for P2P sharing. This is really pretty smart since you can do all of your P2P sharing on committed and specifically configured and stored servers while the remaining servers stay free for faster streaming and browsing. There are loads of dedicated servers so that you don't need to worry about slow rates on packed servers. In addition, TorGuard also offers a specialized torrent proxy, which supports all major torrent customers (BitTorrent, uTorrent, Deluge, Vuse, and many more) and also comes with infinite bandwidth. TorgGuard utilizes OpenVPN/SSTP/L2TP/IPsec encryption protocols. You can Choose whichever you prefer, but many experts recommend using OpenVPN for maximum security. You can link up to five different apparatus using one TorGuard account. This should cover all your devices, from computers to smartphones. TorGuard does not keep any logs whatsoever so all of your relations are 100% anonymous. Torguard Ssl Vpn Customer support is another section where TorGuard does. Their website has an extensive service region with knowledge base, FAQ, troubleshooting, tutorials, forum and a support ticket program. You can also access support from the consumer account area. TorGuard delivers the chat option too. The service team is polite, helpful and friendly. The service ticket system works with answers coming from a matter of 2 or just a moment. TorGuard advertises itself as the VPN service for Torrent users Want to stay absolutely anonymous and secure. In fact, their anonymous proxy service is especially optimized for p2p filesharing and for bypassing geo restrictions, such as watching Netflix or even Hulu in areas where those services are blocked or unavailable. They have 3,000 servers in over 55 countries, such as Saudi Arabia and Egypt. Australia is represented, which can be nice since this region gets neglected. They boast unlimited speeds and switching bandwidth, as well As anonymous webmail support for anonymity and complete privacy, which is remarkable, to say the very least. VPN routers that are pre flashed are also sold by the company. Speed is just one of the regions in which TorGuard prevails. When analyzed, the Speeds were shown to be quite fast, ranging from good to exceptional, very secure and trustworthy. Exceptional results were achieved through the Netherlands and UK servers, which is frequently the case with other VPN providers . Obviously, by linking to remote servers, slower rates were attracted, but that is why you connect to the nearest server. We were pleased to see that there were No WebRTC or DNS leaks at all. Torguard Ssl Vpn There is more than one way to create an encrypted tunnel Through VPN. My preferred method uses the protocol, which will be known for being reliable and fast. Additionally, it is open source, which means that you may rest assured that its code has been picked over for potential vulnerabilities. TorGuard clearly believes in giving people choices, and it Supports numerous VPN protocols, such as OpenVPN, IKEv2, L2TP, and IPSec. TorGuard also includes Stealth VPN protocols, which utilize SSL VPN in order to prevent an entity. These include OpenVPN Stealth, ShadowSocks, Stunnel, and AnyConnect (also known as OpenConnect). Other companies provide tools to stop VPN blocking Similar to Stealth VPN, albeit with different names. TunnelBear and Golden Frog VyprVPN offer this feature, to mention two. A TorGuard representative told me that clients can double up their Stealth protection by connecting via OpenVPN Stealth or OpenConnect then use ShadowSocks or Stunnel to defeat deep packet inspection which could be used to block VPN use. Most people probably will not take advantage of this, but it's good that TorGuard makes such efforts to ensure its users can protect themselves and their data. You need to trust that the VPN you use, because the company Behind it may end up into your actions that are online. That is why when I examine VPNs, I speak with the vendors and read the entire privacy policy. In the case of TorGuard, this last part was straightforward. The business gets and one of the easiest to read. More important, this policy's material is good for consumers. This section says it all:""TorGuard.net doesn't log or store any traffic or usage from its Virtual Private Network (VPN) or Proxy."" The business admits that it will gather personally identifiable information for billing purposes, but keep in mind that it also enables the usage of anonymous payment methods. Yet, TorGuard States that it only earns revenue From subscription revenue, rather than selling data. The company's policy is not to sell or move the information it has gathered to third parties. The sole exception to this is if the company feels it's obliged to comply with legal action. That final point is something echoed by many VPN companies, Which is why it's important to understand under what legal authority they operate and where these businesses are located. Some nations have more legislation that are privacy friendly than many others. The company behind TorGuard is. That company isalso, in turn, owned by parent firm VPNetworks LTD, LLC, located on the Caribbean island of Nevis. I can't talk to this legal framework of Nevis, but for its role that the US has no laws requiring the preservation of data. Before, some VPN businesses utilized to inject ads into Users' web traffic to be able to monetize their customers. An agent from TorGuard affirms that the company doesn't utilize this tactic, stating,""It's not something we'd even consider."" Torguard Ssl Vpn Click here to sign up to Torguard today. Servers and Server Locations I look at the amount of servers when I review VPNs The company has available. The servers there are offered, the more inclined you should find one that is not extremely crowded, giving you a bigger piece of bandwidth. TorGuard has expanded its host supplying, and it Now boasts over 3,000 servers. That puts it up there using Personal Internet Access$2.91 at Private Internet accessibility among the most robust VPN providers I've yet reviewed. NordVPN leads the pack in size. I also look at where those servers are situated. The more Geographic options available, the more choice you have if you want to spoof your location. A strong geographic distribution also means that you are more likely to discover a nearby server when traveling, and a nearby server means lower latency and greater performance. TorGuard now offers VPN servers in over 53 countries. All these are distributed across Europe, Asia, and the Americas. I'm happy to see that TorGuard has servers in India, and several servers around Africa and the Middle East, as these areas tend to be ignored by other VPN services. Especially, TorGuard also has servers in China, Russia, and Turkey, that are known for their repressive internet policies. Hide My Ass dominates using its roster of 286 VPN server places across some 220 countries, but among VPN services. CyberGhost$2.75 in CyberGhosthas fewer server locations, but it will provide physical servers in underserved areas such as Africa and South America. Some customers worry about VPN companies servers. These are software defined servers, which means a single hardware server can run many servers . These servers can be configured to appear to be in various locations than where they are truly located. That is a problem if you would like to steer clear of specific regions, and if you are concerned about where your information is headed. A TorGuard representative explained that the company does not use servers, so you'll have no trouble here. Torguard Ssl Vpn TorGuard Testing In my testing, I installed TorGuard's applications on A Lenovo ThinkPad T460slaptop operating Windows 10. The TorGuard customer installed readily and quickly, though It is not just a thrill to behold. The app is minimal, looking a bit more like a mobile app than something I'd expect on a desktop computer. There are the cheeky donkeys from Hide My Ass, or not one of those adorable bears featured in TunnelBear. It doesn't even have a map interface, and it will be a staple of several VPN apps. Instead, it looks a lot more like the Private online Access. Instead of displaying a map or recommending servers for Particular actions, TorGuard includes a list of servers. That is fine, but again, it is not very friendly to new users. Neither are the arcane choices on the app window. The average user is probably not going to mess with them, but networking pros will undoubtedly enjoy having these choices front and centre. A link at the bottom of the program opens a window filled with even more choices. This program does look like online Access, it appears to target the exact same kind of confident power user. While I am willing to make a Good Deal of adjustments for layout, One aspect of TorGuard's Windows app (and, in reality, all of its apps, too) disturbs me. Will discover which VPN server has the lowest latency or is closest. TorGuard doesn't do so. It's a small thing, but one I'd like to see changed. TorGuard Provides a Kill list, much like NordVPN does. TorGuard will quit any applications on this list, should the VPN connection be interrupted. It's a safety measure. TorGuard's Kill Change is restricted, though. I found that you can add programs which are running to the list. It employs the names you see. NordVPN lets you define applications that aren't running to add to the record, which is handy. VPN services include technical servers. NordVPN And ProtonVPN are two which offer servers specifically for streaming Netflix content. TorGuard has a few: stealth servers meant to be nearly impossible to be blocked by firewalls. Streaming providers take a dim view of VPNs. That is That is not intended for your specific region, As you can use a VPN to spoof your place and access content. If you live in the US but are vacationing in the UK video solutions may block your efforts to VPN back in your home country. While attached to some New York VPN server that is nearby, I was Unable to see any material on Netflix. Of course, that might change in a moment's notice, which will be accurate even for VPNs that worked in my testing with Netflix. Note that section 4.3 of the Netflix terms of support Mentions that where you made your account, you're only entitled to content in the region, and that it uses technologies that are specific to verify your place. It does not explicitly prohibit the use of a VPN for obtaining content, but don't say we didn't warn you if your account gets locked. Beyond VPN TorGuard offers a series of services And privacy online. Along with its fundamental VPN service, TorGuard also sells Anonymous Torrent Proxy for $5.95 a month; Anonymous Email for $6.95 per month; and the Privacy Bundle, which contains both Proxy and VPN support, for $11.95 per month. If you are tempted for the Anonymous Proxy service Rather than the VPN service because it is more affordable, know the proxy is designed to filter BitTorrent visitors, whereas the VPN service protects. If you grabbing a torrent or are seeding torrents, the proxy makes sure nobody sees your real IP address. However, online action and your web browsing is not included. It is a case of online anonymity versus the time. Torguard Ssl Vpn Astonishingly, the TorGuard iPhone apphas a striking, Slick look. It's not going to win any design awards, but it's far, far better than the Windows or Android programs. That said, we think the program that is iPhone is so simple as to be somewhat confusing to use. When we reviewed TorGuardwe noted that it didn't Include our OpenVPN protocol that is preferred. Instead, the program uses IKEv2. We're also pleased to find that its own iPhone VPN performed well in our speed tests on this stage , also. We like that the TorGuard Android apphas a split Tunneling attribute, as well as most of the qualities that you'll find in the Windows program. But, TorGuard drops the ball in style. We find the program to be confusing, and feel it would be off putting to new users. In our testing, it also generated an odd warning. While the TorGuard service is a good one, it is only outshone by Android VPN programs. Regrettably, the TorGuard app does not possess the Modicum of panache that found its way into the program that is iPhone. It's not bad; it fine. It's a gray window to receive your VPN started. TorGuard didn't impress me at the time using its rate test Scores on macOS. I look forward to taking another crack at the program in the near future. That said, I am very happy to see that OpenVPN is included by it. It is one of the macOS VPNs. The Difference Torguard Makes TorGuard has a great deal a reasonable entry level Price, also a large, geographically diverse assortment of servers, and also a collection of subscription add ons to personalize your security experience. Especially notable is its focus on BitTorrent usage, and how it aced our rate tests two factors which are likely related. TorGuard also has an excellent privacy policy, one that's sweet short, and consumer friendly. The exact same can't be stated for its program experience, which has been sacrifice simplicity of use in favor of straightforwardness. This VPN service does a lot , and it gets a high Score for doing so. However, it is neck and neck with Private Internet Access, not just in relation to what it provides but it offers it. Both are privacy focused, both possess lots of options, and neither has a UI that is great. TorGuard, for its part, has the speed but Personal online Access beats on it on endurance, which is the reason why it requires an Editors' Choice award together with TunnelBear and NordVPN. However, TorGuard is. Torguard Ssl Vpn TorGuard offers four different subscription plans Based on the length of the subscription. You are able to subscribe for three months, one month, six months or one year. The longer your subscription interval, the greater the discount. The monthly plan costs $9.99, the Rs subscription costs $19.99, and the semi annual subscription costs $29.99.

TorGuard not only accepts but promotes sharing. But there Are a few things to keep in mind here. There are specific, dedicated servers which should only be used for P2P sharing. This is really pretty smart since you can perform all your P2P sharing on dedicated and especially configured and stored servers while the remaining servers stay free for faster streaming and browsing. There are loads of dedicated servers so that you don't need to worry about slow rates on packed servers. In addition, TorGuard also offers a technical torrent proxy, which supports all major torrent customers (BitTorrent, uTorrent, Deluge, Vuse, and a lot more) and comes with infinite bandwidth. TorgGuard utilizes OpenVPN/SSTP/L2TP/IPsec encryption protocols. You can Choose whichever you prefer, but many experts recommend using OpenVPN for greatest security. You can link as many as five different devices using a single TorGuard account. This should cover all your devices, from computers to smartphones. TorGuard doesn't keep any logs whatsoever so your connections are 100% anonymous. Will Torguard Work With Avast Customer care is just another section where TorGuard does well. Their site has a comprehensive support area with knowledge base, FAQ, troubleshooting, tutorials, forum and a support ticket program. It is also possible to access support from the user accounts area. TorGuard offers the live chat option too. The support staff is friendly, polite and helpful. The support ticket system also works well, with responses coming from a matter of 2 or a moment. Performance and Reliability TorGuard advertises itself as the best VPN service for users Want to remain absolutely anonymous and safe in their online action. In fact, their anonymous proxy support is specifically optimized for p2p filesharing and for bypassing geo restrictions, like watching Netflix or even Hulu in places where those services are either blocked or unavailable. They've 3,000 servers in over 55 countries, including Saudi Arabia and Egypt. Australia is represented, since this area gets ignored which can be nice. They boast switching bandwidth and unlimited speeds, as well As anonymous support for anonymity and privacy, which is remarkable, to say the very least. VPN routers that are pre flashed are also sold by the business. Speed is one of the regions in which TorGuard prevails. When analyzed, the Speeds proved to be quite fast, which range from good to exceptional, very stable and reliable. Exceptional results were achieved through the united kingdom and Netherlands servers, which is frequently the case with other VPN services as well. That you always connect to the server, although Obviously, slower speeds were attracted by linking to more distant servers. We were pleased to see there were No WebRTC or DNS flows at all. Will Torguard Work With Avast VPN Protocols There is more than one way to create an encrypted tunnel Via VPN. My method uses the OpenVPN protocol, which will be famous for being reliable and fast. It, which means you can rest assured that its code was picked over for vulnerabilities. TorGuard clearly believes in giving people options, and it Supports numerous VPN protocols, such as OpenVPN, IKEv2, L2TP, and IPSec. TorGuard also includes Stealth VPN protocols, which utilize SSL VPN in order to prevent an entity. These include OpenVPN Stealth, ShadowSocks, Stunnel, and AnyConnect (also Called OpenConnect). Other companies provide tools to prevent VPN blocking Similar to Stealth VPN, albeit with different names. TunnelBear and Golden Frog VyprVPN offer this attribute, to name two. A TorGuard representative explained that clients can double their Stealth protection by connecting via OpenVPN Stealth or OpenConnect and then use ShadowSocks or Stunnel to conquer deep packet inspection that may be used to obstruct VPN use. Most people probably won't make the most of the, but it's good that TorGuard makes these efforts to make sure its customers can protect their information. You need to trust the VPN you use, because the Firm Behind it may end up with enormous insight in your activities that are internet. That's why when VPNs are reviewed by me, I read the entire privacy policy and talk with all the sellers. In the case of TorGuard, this last part was straightforward. The company gets the smallest privacy policy I have seen, and among the most easy to read. More important, this policy's material is good for consumers. This section says it all:""TorGuard.net does not log or store any traffic or usage from the Virtual Private Network (VPN) or Proxy."" The business admits that it will collect information for billing purposes, but keep in mind that it also enables the usage of anonymous payment procedures. Yet, TorGuard says that it enriches earnings From subscription sales, rather than selling data. The organization's policy isn't to sell or transfer. The exception to this is if the provider believes it's obliged to abide by legal action. That final point is something echoed by VPN companies, Which is why it's important that you know under what legal authority they operate and where these businesses can be found. Some countries have more legislation than many others, after all. The company behind TorGuard is VPNetworks LLC, which can be located in the US. That provider is, in turn, owned by parent firm VPNetworks LTD, LLC, located on the Caribbean island of Nevis. I can't talk to the framework of Nevis, but for its part that the US has no laws requiring the preservation of data. In the past, some VPN businesses used to inject ads into Users' traffic in order to market their users. A representative from TorGuard confirms that the company doesn't utilize this tactic, saying,""It is not something we would even consider."" Will Torguard Work With Avast Click here to subscribe to Torguard today. Servers and Server Locations I look at the amount of servers, While I examine VPNs The company has available. The more servers you will find offered, the more likely you should find one that is not exceptionally crowded, giving you a bigger slice of bandwidth. TorGuard has expanded its host offering, and it Now boasts over 3,000 servers. That puts it up there using Private Internet Access$2.91 at Personal Online Access among the most robust VPN providers I have yet reviewed. NordVPN leads the pack in sheer size encouraging over 5,200 servers. In addition, I look at where these servers are located. The more Geographical selections the more choice you have if you want to spoof your location. A strong geographic distribution also means that you are more likely to find a nearby server when traveling, and also a nearby server ensures lower latency and greater performance. TorGuard currently offers VPN servers in over 53 countries. These are well distributed across Europe, Asia, and the Americas. I am happy to realize that TorGuard has servers in India, and several servers across Africa and the Middle East, since these regions tend to be ignored by other VPN services. Especially, TorGuard also has servers in China, Russia, and Turkey, that are famous for their online policies that are repressive. Hide My Ass dominates with its roster of 286 VPN server places across some 220 countries, however, one of VPN services. CyberGhost$2.75 at CyberGhosthas fewer server locations, but it does offer physical servers in underserved areas such as Africa and South America. Some consumers fear about VPN businesses servers. These are servers that are software defined, which means that a single hardware server can run many virtual servers . These virtual servers can be configured to appear to be than where they're genuinely located. That is an issue if you would like to avoid specific geographic regions, and if you're concerned about where your information is headed. A TorGuard representative told me that the company doesn't use virtual servers, which means you will have no such trouble here. Will Torguard Work With Avast TorGuard Testing In my testing, I installed TorGuard's applications on A Lenovo ThinkPad T460slaptop. The TorGuard customer installed quickly and readily, though It is not a thrill to behold. The program is minimal, appearing somewhat more like a app than something I'd expect on a . You will find none of those adorable bears or the cheeky donkeys from Hide My Ass. It doesn't have a map interface, and it will be a staple of VPN apps. It seems a lot more like the online Access that is Private. Instead of displaying a map or advocating servers for Particular activities, TorGuard just includes a list of servers. That is fine, but it isn't very friendly to new users. Neither are the options on the program's primary window. The typical user is most likely not going to mess with them, but networking pros will no doubt appreciate having these options front and centre. A link at the bottom of the app opens a window filled with options. This app does look like online Access that is Private, it appears to target the kind of power user that is confident. While I am willing to make a Good Deal of allowances for layout, One aspect of TorGuard's Windows program (and, in fact, all of its other apps, too) bothers me. Every other VPN support I have tested will detect which VPN server is nearest or gets the lowest latency. TorGuard doesn't do this. It is a small thing, but changed. TorGuard Provides a Kill Switch list does. TorGuard will quit any applications on this list, if the VPN link be interrupted. It is a security measure. TorGuard's Kill Change is restricted. I discovered that you can add programs which are already running to the list. It also employs the bizarre names you see in the Task Manager, which affords you more control at the cost of usability. NordVPN lets you specify applications that aren't currently running to increase the protected record, which is handy. Other VPN services include specialized servers. NordVPN And ProtonVPN are two which provide servers specifically. TorGuard has a few: stealth servers intended to be almost impossible to be blocked by firewalls. Many streaming services take a dim view of VPNs. That's Because you can use a VPN to spoof your place and get content that's not intended for your geographical region. If you reside in the US but are vacationing in the UK video solutions might block your attempts to VPN back into your house country. While attached to a New York VPN server, I had been Not able to see any content on Netflix. Obviously, which may change at an instant's notice, which is accurate for VPNs that worked with Netflix. Note that section 4.3 of the Netflix terms of service Mentions that it uses technologies to verify your location, which you're only eligible for articles in the region in which you made your account. It does not expressly forbid using a VPN but do not say we didn't warn you if your account gets locked. Beyond VPN TorGuard Delivers a series of services dedicated to anonymity And privacy. In addition to its fundamental VPN service, TorGuard also sells Anonymous Torrent Proxy for $5.95 per month; Anonymous Mail for $6.95 per month; and the Privacy Bundle, which includes both Proxy and VPN support, for $11.95 per month. If you are tempted for the Anonymous Proxy service Rather than the VPN support because it is more affordable, know the proxy was made to filter just BitTorrent traffic, whereas the VPN service protects. If you grabbing a torrent or are currently seeding torrents, the proxy makes sure no one sees your IP address. However, your web browsing and other activity isn't included. It is a case of anonymity sometimes versus all the time. Will Torguard Work With Avast The TorGuard iPhone apphas a striking, Slick appearance. It is not going to win any design awards, but it is far, far better than either the Windows or even Android programs. That said, we think the iPhone program is so easy as to be a bit confusing to use. When we reviewed TorGuardwe noticed that it did not Include our preferred OpenVPN protocol. Instead, the program uses IKEv2. We are also pleased to see that its own iPhone VPN performed well on this stage in our speed tests . We like the TorGuard Android apphas a split Tunneling the majority of the features, as well as feature that you'll see in the Windows app. But, TorGuard drops the ball in style. We find the program feel it will be conducive to new users, and to be perplexing. In our testing, it created an warning upon setup that did not inspire confidence. While the TorGuard service is a great one, it is only outshone by better designed Android VPN programs. Regrettably, the macOS TorGuard program doesn't have the Modicum of panache that found its way into the app. It's not bad; it fine. It's a window to get your VPN started. TorGuard didn't impress me at the time with its speed test Scores on macOS. I look forward to taking another crack. That said, I am pleased to find that it includes OpenVPN. It's among the best macOS VPNs. The Difference Torguard Makes TorGuard has a great deal a Price, a geographically diverse collection of servers, and a collection of subscription add ons to customize your security expertise. Particularly noteworthy is how it aced our rate tests, and also its focus on BitTorrent use two points which are probably associated. TorGuard also has an superb privacy policy, one that's sweet short, and consumer friendly. The exact same can not be stated for its program expertise, which continues to sacrifice simplicity of use in favor of straightforwardness. This VPN service does a lot right, and it has a high For doing this, score. It is neck and neck with online Access, not just in terms of what it provides but it offers it. Both are privacy focused, both possess possibilities, and neither has a UI that is terrific. TorGuard, for its part, has the speed but it is beaten by online Access on usability, which is why it takes an Editors' Choice award together with TunnelBear and NordVPN. However, TorGuard is.

Washington ""Bukka"" White (November 12, 1909 February 26, 1977) was an African American Delta blues guitarist and singer. ""Bukka"" is a phonetic spelling of White's first name, placed on the labels of his early recordings. He preferred the proper spelling of his name, ""Booker,"" as he was named after the well known African American educator and civil rights activist Booker T. Washington. White was born south of Houston, Mississippi. He was a first cousin of B.B. King's mother (White's mother and King's grandmother were sisters). He is remembered as a player of National resonator guitars. He also played piano, but less adeptly. He typically played slide guitar, in an open tuning. He was one of the few, along with Skip James, to use a crossnote tuning in E minor, which he may have learned, as James did, from Henry Stuckey. White started his career playing the fiddle at square dances. He claimed to have met Charlie Patton soon after, but some have doubted this recollection. Nonetheless, Patton was a strong influence on White. He first recorded for Victor Records in 1930. His recordings for Victor, like those of many other bluesmen, included country blues and gospel music. Victor published his photograph in 1930. His gospel songs were done in the style of Blind Willie Johnson, with a female singer accentuating the last phrase of each line. Nine years later, while serving time for assault, he recorded for the folklorist John Lomax. The few songs he recorded around this time became his most well known: ""Shake 'Em On Down,"" and ""Po' Boy."" His 1937 version of the oft recorded song ""Shake 'Em on Down,"" is considered definitive; it became a hit while White was serving time in Parchman. One of his most famous songs, ""Parchman Farm Blues"", about the Mississippi State Penitentiary (also known as Parchman Farm) in Sunflower County, Mississippi, was released on Harry Smith's fourth volume of the Anthology of American Folk Music, Vol. 4. Bob Dylan covered his song ""Fixin' to Die Blues"", which aided a ""rediscovery"" of White in 1963 by guitarist John Fahey and Ed Denson, which propelled him into the folk revival of the 1960s. White had recorded the song simply because his other songs had not particularly impressed the Victor record producer. It was a studio composition of which White had thought little until it re emerged thirty years later. Fahey and Denson found White easily enough: Fahey wrote a letter to ""Bukka White (Old Blues Singer), c/o General Delivery, Aberdeen, Mississippi."" Fahey had assumed, given White's song ""Aberdeen, Mississippi"", that White still lived there or nearby. The postcard was forwarded to Memphis, Tennessee, where White worked in a tank factory. Fahey and Denson soon traveled to meet White, and White and Fahey remained friends through the remainder of White's life. He recorded a new album for Denson and Fahey's Takoma Records, whilst Denson became his manager. White was at one time also managed by experienced blues manager Arne Brogger. Later in his life, White was friends with the musician Furry Lewis. The two recorded an album (mostly in Lewis's Memphis apartment), Furry Lewis, Bukka White & Friends: Party! At Home. White died of cancer in February 1977, at the age of 67, in Memphis, Tennessee. In 1990 he was posthumously inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame (along with Blind Blake and Lonnie Johnson). On November 21, 2011, the Recording Academy announced that ""Fixin' to Die Blues"" was to be added to its 2012 list of Grammy Hall of Fame Award recipients. The Led Zeppelin song ""Hats Off to (Roy) Harper"", on the band's 1970 album Led Zeppelin III, was based in large part on White's ""Shake 'Em on Down."" ""Custard Pie"", a song on Led Zeppelin's 1975 album Physical Graffiti, also references ""Shake 'Em on Down."" The 1963 recordings of White's song ""Shake 'Em on Down"" and spoken word piece ""Remembrance of Charlie Patton"" were both sampled by electronic artist Recoil (mostly a one man effort by Alan Wilder of Depeche Mode) for the track ""Electro Blues for Bukka White"" on the 1992 album Bloodline. The song was reworked and re released on the 2000 EP Jezebel. In 1995, White's ""Aberdeen, Mississippi"" was covered as ""Aberdeen"" by guitarist Kenny Wayne Shepherd on his debut album, Ledbetter Heights. It reached number 23 on the Billboard (North America) Mainstream Rock Tracks in 1996. On January 26, 2010, Eric Bibb released Booker's Guitar (TEL 31756 02) through Telarc International Corporation after becoming inspired by the hidden stories Bibb felt through holding White's famous guitar. White's song ""Parchman Farm Blues"" was recorded by Jeff Buckley, and was released posthumously on the bonus disc of Buckley's album Grace: Legacy Edition.

The space that she holds is all about nurturing individuals to drive peak performance by discovering Ignite GPS (Genius, Purpose, Service) our personal navigation system that leads us to fulfill our highest potential, under Ignite Centre for Peak Experiences. Before joining Ignite, Joana served the aviation industry for almost three decades while thriving in the field of entrepreneurship — from designing and manufacturing her own line of arts and crafts to selling dry goods, managing a flower shop and being an events designer, and never leaving out her social responsibility via community service. She was never content with just being employed. ""I've had many twists and turns in a career that has brought me to hundreds of cities all over the world, first as a flight attendant and cabin manager, then in HQ. After 27 years in aviation, I clipped my wings, and packed the manuscript that I worked on for 4 years entitled, #Metamorphosis: The Ultimate Makeover Manual for 40 Year Olds and Beyond, along with my certifications on wellness coaching and various healing modalities. In a matter of months, I went from wearing two hats in the airline, managing inflight performance while designing and delivering leadership programs to 120 nationalities, to leaving all that and holing up in India for a month to learn yoga, find myself, reinvent my future."" I was 47 then, a wife and mother who had spent the best years of my life flying in and out of my family's life. I had been an expat for so long. I was finally coming home to Manila with a new career in corporate wellness. I thought that was it, my final chapter, time to get settled before entering my golden era. But no. A wise friend once asked me… Joana, you've been in a perfect storm! You're an extreme empath and you've met, served and managed so many more people from so many more countries in 27 years than most people do in 3 lifetimes: those dreams and pains and wants of so many people must have a way of sticking on you, haunting you, no? Yes, exactly; they've haunted me."" Before I jumped into corporate, I designed a program for Filipina overseas workers for people and pain I know so well. I designed a 6 month journey that would help them create their Dream Life Masterplan. I included all the right things I did and didn't do, all the research and study, trial and error, consulting friends and experts, and sleepless nights in search for my truth. So OFWs long separated from their families can speed up their coming home — prepared. Well, my Dream Life Masterplan never reached a single soul. My intention was pure and noble. But I was alone for a huge mission. Fast forward to 2017. A friend invited me to an Ignite gathering and I was never the same again. I found my space, found my missing pieces, found my partners and team. And I found the Ignite GPS: Genius, Purpose, Service. It was my finally embracing my own GPS that really put me on a new journey and challenge: to take care of people beyond wellness, so they can be whole so they can live their deepest truth and so fulfill their highest potential and greatest promise. That's what I found in the Ignite GPS. Today, Joana is leading a team of Gen Z's to launch a human + app coached program to help colleges students find clarity in their life career direction. She also just launched the pilot project of her startup —which partners with farm owners to create viable and sustainable ventures that support agri eco tourism, farm based co creation opportunities, tech guided wellness experiences and socio economic development initiatives. At the rate she's going, nothing can stop her from founding more winning innovations in the next coming years.

That's according to ILGA World (the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association) which has released an update to its State Sponsored Homophobia Report. The report provides data on laws that affect people on the basis of their sexual orientation and paints a vivid picture of the progress and setbacks that happened across the world this year. ILGA World has been able to verify that of those 69 countries, at least 34 have actively enforced their laws criminalising homosexuality over the past five years, but the number is possibly much higher. ""People may get reported and arrested at any time even just under the suspicion of having sex with someone of the same gender. Courts actively prosecute and sentence them to jail, public flogging, or even death,"" said Lucas Ramón Mendos, Research Coordinator at ILGA World and lead author of the report. Some of the negative provisions advanced across the world in the past year include the proliferation of so called ""LGBT free zones"" in Poland, Indonesia seeking to give a new boost to 'conversion therapies' and a reversal of two state level bans on them in Florida, USA, and laws that could severely restrict the operation of NGOs working with our communities. Progress continues in other parts of the world Against all odds, positive developments have taken place even during the past 12 months, despite the challenges imposed by the Covid 19 pandemic. In June, lawmakers in Gabon voted to reverse one year old legislation that outlawed homosexuality and, in July, Sudan repealed the death penalty for consensual same sex sexual acts. This month, Bhutan's parliament moved to legalise homosexuality (although this has yet to be approved by the nation's king). Germany in May became one of the 4 UN member states which banned 'conversion therapies' at the national level, and more jurisdictions in Australia, Canada, Mexico, and the United States followed suit. Marriage equality is now a reality in 28 UN member states: Costa Rica was the latest one to join the list. 34 UN member states provide for some partnership recognition for same sex couples, as Monaco and Montenegro voted to legally recognise them during the past 12 months. As of December 2020, 81 UN member states have laws protecting from discrimination in the workplace on the basis of sexual orientation: twenty years ago, they were only 15. Below are some of the key figures included in the report. Criminalisation of consensual same sex sexual acts There are 124 UN member states (64% of UN member states) where consensual same sex sexual acts between adults are legal. 69 UN member states still criminalise consensual same sex sexual acts between adults (67 by explicit provisions of law, 2 de facto). Additionally, these acts are criminalised in one non independent territory (Cook Islands, New Zealand) and in certain jurisdictions within two UN member states (Gaza in Palestine and certain provinces in Indonesia) In 6 UN member states, the death penalty is the legally prescribed punishment for consensual same sex sexual acts: Brunei, Iran, Mauritania, Nigeria (12 Northern states only), Saudi Arabia and Yemen In 5 additional UN member states Afghanistan, Pakistan, Qatar, Somalia (including Somaliland) and the United Arab Emirates certain sources indicate that the death penalty could potentially be imposed for consensual same sex conduct, but there is less legal certainty on the matter. Restriction of rights At least 42 UN member states have legal barriers to freedom of expression on sexual orientation and gender identity issues At least 51 UN member states have legal barriers to the formation, establishment or registration of NGOs working on issues related sexual and gender diversity. Protection from discrimination 11 UN member states contain constitutional provisions that specify sexual orientation in their anti discrimination protections 57 UN member states offer broad protections against discrimination based on sexual orientation including in education, health, the provision of goods and services and/or housing 81 UN member states have laws protecting from workplace discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation 48 UN member states impose enhanced criminal penalties for offences motivated by hate towards the victim's sexual orientation 45 UN member states have laws that punish acts of incitement to hatred, discrimination or violence based on sexual orientation 4 UN member states (Brazil, Ecuador, Germany, Malta) have nationwide bans against ""conversion therapies"". There are subnational bans in 5 other UN member states: Australia, Canada, Mexico, Spain, United States. Recognition of rainbow families 28 UN member states recognise same sex marriage. One non UN member jurisdiction (Taiwan) has also legalised same sex marriage. 34 UN member states provide for some partnership recognition 28 states have joint adoption laws, while 32 states allow for same sex second parent adoption.","Home International 69 UN Member States Against LGBTQI+ activities Report 69 UN Member States Against LGBTQI+ activities Report Consensual same sex activity is still illegal in 69 UN member states, says the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association (ILGA) World. ILGA World 2020 report has revealed 69 UN member states still criminalise consensual same sex marriage among adults. According to the group, 67 of these countries have criminalised LGBTQI+ activities by explicit law provisions, while the other two are de facto. The report also revealed 34 UN Member States provide some partnership recognition for same sex couples, as Monaco and Montenegro have voted to recognise them legally during the past 12 months. ""As of December 2020, 81 UN Member States have laws protecting from discrimination in the workplace based on sexual orientation: 20 years ago, they were only 15,"" the report stated. The report further indicated that ""in July 2020 Sudan repealed the death penalty on consensual same sex sexual acts. In addition, Germany has now become one of the four UN Member States which banned 'conversion therapies' at the national level, and more jurisdictions in Australia, Canada, Mexico, and the United States followed suit"". According to the Director of Programs at ILGA World, Julia Ehrt, this publication will be a ""vital source of information for human rights defenders, States, researchers, media and the general public on how laws affect people on the grounds of their sexual orientation,"" Below are some key findings of the report: Criminalisation of consensual same sex sexual acts 69 UN Member States still criminalise consensual same sex sexual acts between adults (67 by explicit provisions of law, 2 de facto). In 6 UN member States, the death penalty is the legally prescribed punishment for consensual same sex sexual acts: Brunei, Iran, Mauritania, Nigeria (12 Northern states only), Saudi Arabia and Yemen.

The long lost recordings were captured by a mobile studio that now resides at Studio Bell in Calgary as part of Canada's National Music Centre. Before calling Canada home, the studio was owned by the Rolling Stones, who had the mobile facility constructed in 1968 and recorded multiple acts over the years, including Marley. It was later acquired by the National Music Centre in 2001, and following a restoration project, it continues to record artists today. ""This truck was available for hire,"" Jason Tawkin, manager of building audio at Studio Bell, told CTV. ""It was owned by the Rolling Stones but it was also a side business for them. They had invested a significant amount of money into it and they wanted a return on that investment."" The Marley tapes in question were captured live in London and Paris in the '70s, but they were thought to be lost over the years. Recently, though, the 2 inch reel to reel 24 track analogue tapes were saved from a London dump and digitally restored. Now, they are set to go on auction later this month. Among the recovered reels are recordings of Bob Marley and the Wailers in London at the Lyceum in 1975, the Hammersmith Odeon in 1976 and the Rainbow in 1977, in addition to a concert at France's Pavilion de Paris in 1978. As Tawkin explained, Marley was among many who used the Stones' mobile studio. ""There's lots of stories in the industry of tapes being lost,"" he said. ""I know of one story where Jimi Hendrix left one of the master tapes in a cab in New York City. Where that tape is now? No one knows. These things just fall off the back of the truck, if you will, and the cool thing about tape is that when you do recover it, there's usually a way to recover the content that's within those tapes because of the technology.""

From correspondence a version appears to have been distributed in 1513, using a Latin title, De Principatibus (About Principalities). But the printed version was not published until 1532, five years after Machiavelli's death. This was done with the permission of the Medici pope Clement VII, but ""long before then, in fact since the first appearance of the Prince in manuscript, controversy had swirled about his writings"" Although it was written as if it were a traditional work in the Mirror of Princes style, it is generally agreed that it was especially innovative, and not only because it was written in Italian rather than Latin. The Prince is sometimes claimed to be one of the first works of modern philosophy, in which the effective truth is taken to be more important than any abstract ideal. It was also in direct conflict with the dominant Catholic and scholastic doctrines of the time concerning how to consider politics and ethics. Although it is relatively short, the treatise is the most remembered of his works and the one most responsible for bringing ""Machiavellian"" into wide usage as a pejorative term. It also helped make ""Old Nick"" an English term for the devil, and even contributed to the modern negative connotations of the words ""politics"" and ""politician"" in western countries. In terms of subject matter it overlaps with the much longer Discourses on Livy, which was written a few years later. In its use of examples who were politically active Italians who perpetrated criminal deeds for politics, another lesser known work by Machiavelli which The Prince has been compared to is the Life of Castruccio Castracani. The descriptions within The Prince have the general theme of accepting that ends of princes, such as glory, and indeed survival, can justify the use of immoral means to achieve those ends.

However, the printed version was not published until 1532, five years after Machiavelli s death.

Although it was written as if it were a traditional work in the mirrors for princes style, it is generally agreed that it was especially innovative. This is only partly because it was written in the vernacular Italian rather than Latin, a practice which had become increasingly popular since the publication of Dante s Divine Comedy and other works of Renaissance literature. The Prince is sometimes claimed to be one of the first works of modern philosophy, especially modern political philosophy, in which the effective truth is taken to be more important than any abstract ideal.

According to the Director of Programs at ILGA World, Julia Ehrt, this publication will be a ""vital source of information for human rights defenders, States, researchers, media and the general public on how laws affect people on the grounds of their sexual orientation,"" Below are some key findings of the report: Criminalisation of consensual same sex sexual acts 69 UN Member States still criminalise consensual same sex sexual acts between adults (67 by explicit provisions of law, 2 de facto). In 6 UN member States, the death penalty is the legally prescribed punishment for consensual same sex sexual acts: Brunei, Iran, Mauritania, Nigeria (12 Northern states only), Saudi Arabia and Yemen. Restriction of rights At least 42 UN member States have legal barriers to freedom of expression on sexual orientation and gender identity issues. At least 51 UN member States have legal barriers to the formation, establishment or registration of NGOs working on issues related sexual and gender diversity. Protection from discrimination 11 UN member States contain constitutional provisions that specify sexual orientation in their anti discrimination protections. 57 UN member States offer broad protections against discrimination based on sexual orientation including in education, health, the provision of goods and services and/or housing. 81 UN member States have laws protecting from workplace discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. 48 UN member States impose enhanced criminal penalties for offences motivated by hate towards the victim's sexual orientation. 45 UN member States have laws that punish acts of incitement to hatred, discrimination or violence based on sexual orientation. 4 UN member States (Brazil, Ecuador, Germany, Malta) have nationwide bans against ""conversion therapies"".

That's according to ILGA World (the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association) which has released an update to its State Sponsored Homophobia Report. The report provides data on laws that affect people on the basis of their sexual orientation and paints a vivid picture of the progress and setbacks that happened across the world this year. ILGA World has been able to verify that of those 69 countries, at least 34 have actively enforced their laws criminalising homosexuality over the past five years, but the number is possibly much higher. ""People may get reported and arrested at any time even just under the suspicion of having sex with someone of the same gender. Courts actively prosecute and sentence them to jail, public flogging, or even death,"" said Lucas Ramón Mendos, Research Coordinator at ILGA World and lead author of the report. Some of the negative provisions advanced across the world in the past year include the proliferation of so called ""LGBT free zones"" in Poland, Indonesia seeking to give a new boost to 'conversion therapies' and a reversal of two state level bans on them in Florida, USA, and laws that could severely restrict the operation of NGOs working with our communities. Progress continues in other parts of the world Against all odds, positive developments have taken place even during the past 12 months, despite the challenges imposed by the Covid 19 pandemic. In June, lawmakers in Gabon voted to reverse one year old legislation that outlawed homosexuality and, in July, Sudan repealed the death penalty for consensual same sex sexual acts. This month, Bhutan's parliament moved to legalise homosexuality (although this has yet to be approved by the nation's king). Germany in May became one of the 4 UN member states which banned 'conversion therapies' at the national level, and more jurisdictions in Australia, Canada, Mexico, and the United States followed suit. Marriage equality is now a reality in 28 UN member states: Costa Rica was the latest one to join the list. 34 UN member states provide for some partnership recognition for same sex couples, as Monaco and Montenegro voted to legally recognise them during the past 12 months. As of December 2020, 81 UN member states have laws protecting from discrimination in the workplace on the basis of sexual orientation: twenty years ago, they were only 15. Below are some of the key figures included in the report. Criminalisation of consensual same sex sexual acts There are 124 UN member states (64% of UN member states) where consensual same sex sexual acts between adults are legal. 69 UN member states still criminalise consensual same sex sexual acts between adults (67 by explicit provisions of law, 2 de facto). Additionally, these acts are criminalised in one non independent territory (Cook Islands, New Zealand) and in certain jurisdictions within two UN member states (Gaza in Palestine and certain provinces in Indonesia) In 6 UN member states, the death penalty is the legally prescribed punishment for consensual same sex sexual acts: Brunei, Iran, Mauritania, Nigeria (12 Northern states only), Saudi Arabia and Yemen In 5 additional UN member states Afghanistan, Pakistan, Qatar, Somalia (including Somaliland) and the United Arab Emirates certain sources indicate that the death penalty could potentially be imposed for consensual same sex conduct, but there is less legal certainty on the matter. Restriction of rights At least 42 UN member states have legal barriers to freedom of expression on sexual orientation and gender identity issues At least 51 UN member states have legal barriers to the formation, establishment or registration of NGOs working on issues related sexual and gender diversity.

And no surprise, the group features Brotzmann on tenor and Bailey on guitar alongside Misha Mengelberg on piano, Evan Parker on soprano and tenor, Peter Bennink on alto and bagpipes, Paul Rutherford on trombone, and Han Bennink on drums and percussion! Nearly every one of these musicians were emerging giants at the time and together, they really live up to the promise of the title moving fast and fiercely, with uncanny understanding of each other as they maybe even blow away the famous American album length improvisations with one of their own. © 1996 2019, Dusty Groove, Inc. We realize that there are many different interpretations of the standard grades used for pre owned vinyl record albums & CD, so we thought we'd offer you the ones that we are working with, so you have an idea what we mean when we give the grade for a non new item on our pages. Used Vinyl Grades Below are stated conditions for a used vinyl records at Dusty Groove. Grading for the cover should be assumed to be near (within a ""+"" or "" "") the grading for the vinyl. If there is significant divergence from the condition of the vinyl, or specific flaws, these will be noted in the comments section of the item. However, please be aware that since the emphasis of this site is towards the music listener, our main concern is with the vinyl of any used item we sell. Additionally, all of our records are graded visually; considering the volume of used vinyl we handle, it is impossible for us to listen to each record. If we spot any significant flaws, we make every attempt to listen through them and note how they play. The following grading conditions apply to the vinyl component of an album or single: This is what it says, that the record is still held fast in shrink wrap. We tend to be pretty suspicious about these things, so if the shrink wrap doesn't look original, or if the record seems to have undergone some damage over time, we'll probably take it out of the wrapper to ensure that it's in good shape — which is why we don't have more of these. In some cases the shrink wrap may be torn in spots, but if it's not possible the record has been taken out and played, the record will still qualify as ""Sealed"". Dusty Groove does not use the grades of Near Mint (or Mint, for that matter) because in our experience, we find that no records ever qualify for such a high grade. Even sealed records tend to have one or two slight faults, enough to usually qualify them for a grade of NM or lower. We've often found that records which are clearly unplayed will have a slight amount of surface noise, especially in quieter recordings. Near Mint (minus) Black vinyl that may show a slight amount of dust or dirt. Should still be very shiny under a light, even with slight amount of dust on surface. One or two small marks that would make an otherwise near perfect record slightly less so. These marks cannot be too deep, and should only be surface marks that won't affect play, but might detract from the looks. May have some flaws and discoloration in the vinyl, but only those that would be intrinsic to the pressing. These should disappear when the record is tilted under the light, and will only show up when looking straight at the record. (Buddah and ABC pressings from the 70's are a good example of this.) May have some slight marks from aging of the paper sleeve on the vinyl. Possible minor surface noise when played. Very Good + (plus) Vinyl should be very clean, but can have less luster than near mint. Should still shine under a light, but one or two marks may show up when tilted. Can have a few small marks that may show up easily, but which do not affect play at all. Most marks of this quality will disappear when the record is tilted, and will not be felt with the back of a fingernail. This is the kind of record that will play ""near mint"", but which will have some signs of use (although not major ones). May have slight surface noise when played. Vinyl can have some dirt, but nothing major. May not shine under light, but should still be pretty clean, and not too dirty. May have a number of marks (5 to 10 at most), and obvious signs of play, but never a big cluster of them, or any major mark that would be very deep. Most marks should still not click under a fingernail. May not look near perfect, but should play fairly well, with slight surface noise, and the occasional click in part of a song, but never throughout a whole song or more. This is clearly a copy that was played by someone a number of times, but which could also be a good ""play copy"" for someone new. Very Good (minus) Vinyl may be dirty, and can lack a fair amount of luster. Vinyl can have a number of marks, either in clusters or smaller amounts, but deeper. This is the kind of record that you'd buy to play, but not because it looked that great. Still, the flaws should be mostly cosmetic, with nothing too deep that would ruin the overall record. Examples include a record that has been kept for a while in a cover without the paper sleeve, or heavily played by a previous owner and has some marks across the surface. The record should play okay, though probably with surface noise. Good + (plus) Vinyl may be dirty, or have one outstanding flaw, such as a light residue, which could be difficult to clean. May have marks on all parts, too many to qualify as Very Good , or several deeper marks, but the record should still be ok for play without skips. In general, this is a record that was played a fair amount, and handled without care. A typical example may be a record which has been heavily played by a DJ, and carries marks from slip cueing. Depending on the quality of the vinyl, may play with surface noise throughout. A record that you'd buy to play, cheap, but which you wouldn't buy for collecting. Will have marks across all parts of the playing surface, and will most likely play with surface noise throughout. May have some other significant flaws, such as residue, or a track that skips. In most cases, a poor quality copy of a very difficult to find record. This is a grade we rarely use, as we try not to sell records in very bad condition, though in some rare cases we will list a record in such bad shape that it does not conform to the standards above. A ""Fair"" record will have enough marks or significant flaws that it does not even qualify as ""Good"", but is a copy you might consider for playing, if you're willing to put up with noise and/or flaws. An example might be a recording with surface noise so heavy that it is equal to the volume of the music. For records listed as ""Fair"", we will describe the extent of the condition in the comments. Like ""Fair"", we rarely list records in this condition, as they represent the extreme low end of spectrum. These records typically have multiple serious problems, and we offer them as ""relics"" or ""objects"" only — for those who want to at least have a copy of a record, even if it is not really worthy of play, perhaps for the cover alone. For these records, we will describe the extent of the condition in the comments. Additional Marks & Notes If something is noteworthy, we try to note it in the comments — especially if it is an oddity that is the only wrong thing about the record. This might include, but isn't limited to, warped records, tracks that skip, cover damage or wear as noted above, or strictly cosmetic flaws. Used CD Grade We have only one grade for non new CDs at Dusty Groove — ""Used CD"". This grade is somewhat all encompassing, but we choose it because we try to offer Used CDs in the best shape possible. All of our Used CDs are guaranteed to play without skipping or flaws. If you purchase a Used CD from Dusty Groove, you have 1 week to play it to determine that it plays correctly — and if it does not, then you may return it for a full refund. With our Used CDs, you can expect the disc to be free of all but the lightest of surface marks — clean, and not dirty at all. You can also expect the case to be clean (we often change the cases ourselves — putting fresh cases on Used CDs we handle) — and you can expect the booklet to be in good shape, unless noted otherwise. We will list any specific details/defects underneath the item — so look for notes on cutout marks in the case, stamps on the barcode, or details like that.

We realize that there are many different interpretations of the standard grades used for pre owned vinyl record albums & CD, so we thought we'd offer you the ones that we are working with, so you have an idea what we mean when we give the grade for a non new item on our pages. Used Vinyl Grades Below are stated conditions for a used vinyl records at Dusty Groove. Grading for the cover should be assumed to be near (within a ""+"" or "" "") the grading for the vinyl. If there is significant divergence from the condition of the vinyl, or specific flaws, these will be noted in the comments section of the item. However, please be aware that since the emphasis of this site is towards the music listener, our main concern is with the vinyl of any used item we sell. Additionally, all of our records are graded visually; considering the volume of used vinyl we handle, it is impossible for us to listen to each record. If we spot any significant flaws, we make every attempt to listen through them and note how they play. The following grading conditions apply to the vinyl component of an album or single: This is what it says, that the record is still held fast in shrink wrap. We tend to be pretty suspicious about these things, so if the shrink wrap doesn't look original, or if the record seems to have undergone some damage over time, we'll probably take it out of the wrapper to ensure that it's in good shape — which is why we don't have more of these. In some cases the shrink wrap may be torn in spots, but if it's not possible the record has been taken out and played, the record will still qualify as ""Sealed"". Dusty Groove does not use the grades of Near Mint (or Mint, for that matter) because in our experience, we find that no records ever qualify for such a high grade. Even sealed records tend to have one or two slight faults, enough to usually qualify them for a grade of NM or lower. We've often found that records which are clearly unplayed will have a slight amount of surface noise, especially in quieter recordings. Near Mint (minus) Black vinyl that may show a slight amount of dust or dirt. Should still be very shiny under a light, even with slight amount of dust on surface. One or two small marks that would make an otherwise near perfect record slightly less so. These marks cannot be too deep, and should only be surface marks that won't affect play, but might detract from the looks. May have some flaws and discoloration in the vinyl, but only those that would be intrinsic to the pressing. These should disappear when the record is tilted under the light, and will only show up when looking straight at the record. (Buddah and ABC pressings from the 70's are a good example of this.) May have some slight marks from aging of the paper sleeve on the vinyl. Possible minor surface noise when played. Very Good + (plus) Vinyl should be very clean, but can have less luster than near mint. Should still shine under a light, but one or two marks may show up when tilted. Can have a few small marks that may show up easily, but which do not affect play at all. Most marks of this quality will disappear when the record is tilted, and will not be felt with the back of a fingernail. This is the kind of record that will play ""near mint"", but which will have some signs of use (although not major ones). May have slight surface noise when played. Vinyl can have some dirt, but nothing major. May not shine under light, but should still be pretty clean, and not too dirty. May have a number of marks (5 to 10 at most), and obvious signs of play, but never a big cluster of them, or any major mark that would be very deep. Most marks should still not click under a fingernail. May not look near perfect, but should play fairly well, with slight surface noise, and the occasional click in part of a song, but never throughout a whole song or more.

She's also the Managing Director of the Guild by Ni2, a dedicated team that focuses on career and OJT acceleration of college students and fresh grads at scale. The space that she holds is all about nurturing individuals to drive peak performance by discovering Ignite GPS (Genius, Purpose, Service) our personal navigation system that leads us to fulfill our highest potential, under Ignite Centre for Peak Experiences. Before joining Ignite, Joana served the aviation industry for almost three decades while thriving in the field of entrepreneurship — from designing and manufacturing her own line of arts and crafts to selling dry goods, managing a flower shop and being an events designer, and never leaving out her social responsibility via community service. She was never content with just being employed. ""I've had many twists and turns in a career that has brought me to hundreds of cities all over the world, first as a flight attendant and cabin manager, then in HQ. After 27 years in aviation, I clipped my wings, and packed the manuscript that I worked on for 4 years entitled, #Metamorphosis: The Ultimate Makeover Manual for 40 Year Olds and Beyond, along with my certifications on wellness coaching and various healing modalities. In a matter of months, I went from wearing two hats in the airline, managing inflight performance while designing and delivering leadership programs to 120 nationalities, to leaving all that and holing up in India for a month to learn yoga, find myself, reinvent my future."" I was 47 then, a wife and mother who had spent the best years of my life flying in and out of my family's life. I had been an expat for so long. I was finally coming home to Manila with a new career in corporate wellness. I thought that was it, my final chapter, time to get settled before entering my golden era. But no. A wise friend once asked me… Joana, you've been in a perfect storm! You're an extreme empath and you've met, served and managed so many more people from so many more countries in 27 years than most people do in 3 lifetimes: those dreams and pains and wants of so many people must have a way of sticking on you, haunting you, no? Yes, exactly; they've haunted me."" Before I jumped into corporate, I designed a program for Filipina overseas workers for people and pain I know so well. I designed a 6 month journey that would help them create their Dream Life Masterplan. I included all the right things I did and didn't do, all the research and study, trial and error, consulting friends and experts, and sleepless nights in search for my truth. So OFWs long separated from their families can speed up their coming home — prepared. Well, my Dream Life Masterplan never reached a single soul. My intention was pure and noble. But I was alone for a huge mission. Fast forward to 2017. A friend invited me to an Ignite gathering and I was never the same again. I found my space, found my missing pieces, found my partners and team. And I found the Ignite GPS: Genius, Purpose, Service. It was my finally embracing my own GPS that really put me on a new journey and challenge: to take care of people beyond wellness, so they can be whole so they can live their deepest truth and so fulfill their highest potential and greatest promise. That's what I found in the Ignite GPS. Today, Joana is leading a team of Gen Z's to launch a human + app coached program to help colleges students find clarity in their life career direction. She also just launched the pilot project of her startup —which partners with farm owners to create viable and sustainable ventures that support agri eco tourism, farm based co creation opportunities, tech guided wellness experiences and socio economic development initiatives. At the rate she's going, nothing can stop her from founding more winning innovations in the next coming years. A genuine Iska — a graduate of the University of the Philippines, her mission no doubt is to make an impact on the lives of her kabayans, dreaming to make her country a better place.

Every month, it features in the list of best selling two wheelers. Three months ago, Honda had launched the newer version of its successful scooter Activa with BS6 emission norms and named it as Activa 6G. Within three months of its launch, Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India has announced an increase in prices of their Honda Activa 6G models. The price increase though is marginal from Rs. 4000 onwards. The scooter is available in two variants, and is now priced starting at Rs 64,464. The Honda Activa 6G was launched during January this year and arrived with a host of updates and new features. The models arrive with longer dimensions, better ground clearance, and a longer wheelbase. The 2020 Honda Activa 6G models feature an ACG starter, LED headlamps (on the Deluxe variant), and engine start/ stop button, an external fuel filler cap, and 18 litre under seat storage. But apart from the change in price, the scooter remains the same as before. It's powered by a new 109.51cc single cylinder air cooled fuel injected motor that churns out 7.79PS and 8.79Nm, which is 0.17PS and 0.21Nm less than the Honda Activa 5G. Underpinnings include a telescopic front fork and a 3 step preload adjustable single shock absorber at the rear. In mid March, Honda issued a recall for the Activa 6G as well as the Dio BS6 and the Activa 125 BS6. The Honda Activa 6G BS6 models are available in six different colors Black, Dazzle Yellow Metallic, Glitter Blue Metallic, Matte Axis Grey Metallic, Pearl Precious White, and Pearl Spartan Red. The Honda Activa 6G competes with the Hero Pleasure Plus BS6 and TVS Jupiter BS6.

Along with the Activa 6G, the Activa 125 was also made costlier in April. The Activa 6G BS 6 now starts at a price tag of ₹65,419*, which is an increment of ₹955 against its previous entry level price of ₹64,464*. The Activa 125 BS 6 is available at a starting price of ₹68,997*, as against ₹68,042*, this is also ₹955 higher against the older pricing.

McKinney is working through the series slowly, swapping the first set for the next, and the next, as her teeth move. It'll take about nine months in all. However after three months of using these trays practically every day and night, McKinney is excited about flaunting her new smile (Smile Direct Club Black Triangles After Treatment). Danny Menendez/ BuzzFeed News Inside among SmileDirectClub's New York City locations. SmileDirectClub's organisation design seems working. Align Innovation the company that makes Invisalign, SmileDirect's primary competitor invested $46.7 million to end up being SmileDirect's special supplier last year, and this year invested another $12.8 million, to own a total of 19% of the business. On the other hand, lookalikes have actually introduced with comparable services: Orthly, released by 2 University of Pennsylvania trainees, now provides services to customers in Philadelphia, and Candid Co. introduced in New york city this summer. A SmileDirect client can be matched with among 225 affiliated dental experts or orthodontists in all 50 states. These oral specialists from another location review client cases and after that create the aligners that SmileDirect sends in the mail. The business decreased to call any of the medical experts within its network, and would not offer details about its financial relationships with them. ""Essentially they are collecting payments and paying us marketing charges,"" Fenkell said.""I believe that claim is rather fake,"" AAO's basic counsel Dillard stated. ""The consumers don't even see a dentist. (SmileDirectClub has a two star rating on Yelp.) And many professional dental practitioners are alarmed that clients never see a licensed physician before or throughout their treatment.""It blew my mind,"" Casi Stubbs, a Florida orthodontist and member of the American Association of Orthodontists, told BuzzFeed News. Like common orthodontists, SmileDirect's dentists base their prescriptions on computer simulations of mouth scans. ""The teeth do not move biologically like they do on the computer system,"" Stubbs stated. Among her clients, 60 year old Charlene Burnham, is a SmileDirect customer whose too tight aligners cut her gums, exposing part of her tooth near the root. Burnham told BuzzFeed News she spent a week trying and stopping working to speak to a SmileDirect dental professional on the phone, then went to Stubbs for help.""They were bleeding, they were cut to the root,"" Burnham said. ""I was appalled.""A SmileDirect representative informed BuzzFeed News by email that company affiliated dentists ""track the client's development throughout treatment at routine intervals.""The company ""helps with the communications"" of clients and dental companies, the agent stated. ""Oral companies communicate directly with clients through the customer portal and via SMS or phone when appropriate or shown.""In a YouTube video that's been seen over 21,000 times considering that June, Baltimore orthodontist Jeffrey Miller warned individuals away from the service, stating that no orthodontist would ever prescribe aligners without first taking the X rays that SmileDirect skips. (The video was gotten rid of after this story published.)Grant Olson, a dental practitioner in Springfield, Missouri, informed BuzzFeed News that the company's item marketing, which compares itself with orthodontist fitted Invisalign, is misinforming. Unlike Invisalign trays, which orthodontists can optimize by sticking unique accessories on a tooth, SmileDirect's item is limited to very minor corrections: The aligners can fix a tilt, however can't move a tooth's orientation or position in addition to its root. He described that SmileDirect affiliated orthodontists only authorize cases that are appropriate for a remote consultation and do not need follow up oral sees (Smile Direct Club Black Triangles After Treatment). Laws for dentists differ throughout states, however there are some typical styles in the 36 problems sent out by the AAO: Some states think about making impressions and providing retainers to be the role of a licensed doctor, but SmileDirectClub generally supplies those services. AAO basic counsel Dillard likewise informed BuzzFeed News that the business's service design incentivizes dentists associated with SmileDirect to prescribe the trays even if they aren't necessary. Danny Menendez/ BuzzFeed News Although the business hasn't attracted the attention of regulators yet, client grievances abound online. TL; DR: Get ready for a rough trip. The vast majority of customers in these groups resign themselves to dealing with the snags due to the fact that there are simply no other choices (Smile Direct Club Black Triangles After Treatment).""If you can be client, desire an economical plan, SDC IS the ideal method to go! Having a positive mindset and being patient goes a LONG method,"" Melanie Masso wrote to BuzzFeed News. For many other clients, the ride is a bust. Seattle resident Melissa Gulick told BuzzFeed News that at the end of nearly a year of treatment, the aligners have destroyed her bite: Her front teeth touch prior to her molars can make contact (Smile Direct Club Black Triangles After Treatment). ""I'm pretty irritated food is tough to chew now and they won't repair it!""Gulick stated that after complaints to the business, SmileDirectClub consented to continue treatment totally free. When asked about problems that the trays messed up clients' bites, a SmileDirect representative informed BuzzFeed News: ""Over 95% of our consumers complete treatment and validate their ended up brand new smile. It is necessary to keep in mind that with any orthodontic treatment, bites will continue to shift until the treatment is completed.""Another consumer, 24 year old Drexel College student Kacie Durham, informed BuzzFeed News that SmileDirectClub sent her a simulated treatment plan that made her teeth look worse.""It actually made my teeth appear more uneven at the bottom,"" she said. Durham returned her trays and made an application for a refund. Later on, an orthodontist not associated with the company informed her that her teeth would have to be submitted and formed prior to they might be lined up. Durham felt duped: SmileDirect had actually approved her for a treatment that would never have worked.""If a possible consumer is dissatisfied with the 3d preview of his or her smile, there is no commitment to acquire aligners,"" the SmileDirectClub representative stated (Smile Direct Club Black Triangles After Treatment). Minelle Tendler, a Boca Raton orthodontist, signed up with one of the biggest Facebook groups, the 11,800 member SmileDirectClub Assistance, after two of her patients asked about the item. In browsing the posts that appear in her Facebook feed, Tendler said that she's not seen anybody say they've had the ability to talk to a dental professional at the business. ""You're asking someone who has no oral background, 'Is this going to work?'""More than as soon as, Tendler has stopped short of responding to threads on the online forum. She sits on her hands because the patients are not hers. ""I'm taking a look at the pictures and thinking, Oh my god, you require to get teeth gotten, do not do it.""Mainly, she is stressed that individuals who are charmed by SmileDirectClub's low cost aren't fully familiar with the disadvantages of avoiding a dental go to. A previous version of this short article misidentified him as an orthodontist. Align Technology owns 19% of SmileDirectClub. A previous variation of this story stated it was 17%. Likewise, SmileDirectClub began running in North Carolina in early October. A previous variation of this story, based on an August interview with cofounder Alex Fenkell, said that the business was not running in North Carolina. Mail in aligners might appear like an excellent alternative for a small fix. But keep in mind you're not the professional on how minimal a fix your teeth require. ""It's difficult to go from something that's 90% good to make it 100% ideal; in my experience, I find that these are the more difficult cases,"" Dr. The outcomes of using invisible aligners can be very unpredictable, due to the fact that some people react well to them and others won't. ""It's really tough to monitor this on your own, because like whatever in medication not everyone reacts the exact same,"" he says. The genuine difficulty comes with figuring out how to fix your smile if you're not responding properly to the retainers, he states.

The business decreased to call any of the physician within its network, and would not supply details about its financial relationships with them. ""Essentially they are collecting payments and paying us marketing costs,"" Fenkell said.""I think that claim is rather phony,"" AAO's basic counsel Dillard stated. ""The consumers don't even see a dental professional. (SmileDirectClub has a two star rating on Yelp.) And many expert dental experts are alarmed that clients never ever see a licensed physician prior to or throughout their treatment.""It blew my mind,"" Casi Stubbs, a Florida orthodontist and member of the American Association of Orthodontists, informed BuzzFeed News. Like typical orthodontists, SmileDirect's dental professionals base their prescriptions on computer simulations of mouth scans. ""The teeth don't move biologically like they do on the computer system,"" Stubbs said. Among her patients, 60 year old Charlene Burnham, is a SmileDirect client whose too tight aligners cut her gums, exposing part of her tooth near the root. Burnham told BuzzFeed News she invested a week attempting and failing to talk with a SmileDirect dental professional on the phone, then went to Stubbs for help.""They were bleeding, they were cut to the root,"" Burnham stated. ""I was horrified.""A SmileDirect representative told BuzzFeed News by e mail that company affiliated dentists ""track the client's development throughout treatment at routine periods.""The company ""assists in the interactions"" of customers and oral providers, the representative said. ""Oral suppliers interact directly with patients through the consumer portal and via SMS or phone when suitable or indicated.""In a YouTube video that's been seen over 21,000 times given that June, Baltimore orthodontist Jeffrey Miller alerted individuals far from the service, stating that no orthodontist would ever prescribe aligners without first taking the X rays that SmileDirect avoids. (The video was removed after this story released.)Grant Olson, a dentist in Springfield, Missouri, informed BuzzFeed News that the company's item marketing, which compares itself with orthodontist fitted Invisalign, is misguiding. Unlike Invisalign trays, which orthodontists can enhance by sticking special accessories on a tooth, SmileDirect's product is restricted to extremely minor corrections: The aligners can correct a tilt, but can't move a tooth's orientation or position in addition to its root. He described that SmileDirect affiliated orthodontists just authorize cases that are suitable for a remote assessment and do not need follow up dental check outs (Smile Direct Club Deals Buy One Get One Free April). Laws for dental professionals differ across states, but there are some common themes in the 36 grievances sent by the AAO: Some states consider making impressions and supplying retainers to be the role of a licensed medical professional, but SmileDirectClub normally offers those services. AAO general counsel Dillard also told BuzzFeed News that the business's service model incentivizes dental practitioners associated with SmileDirect to recommend the trays even if they aren't required. Danny Menendez/ BuzzFeed News Although the company hasn't attracted the attention of regulators yet, consumer problems are plentiful online. TL; DR: Get ready for a rough flight. The large bulk of customers in these groups resign themselves to handling the snags because there are simply no other alternatives (Smile Direct Club Deals Buy One Get One Free April).""If you can be client, want an inexpensive plan, SDC IS the ideal method to go! Having a favorable attitude and being patient goes a LONG way,"" Melanie Masso composed to BuzzFeed News. For numerous other consumers, the flight is a bust. Seattle resident Melissa Gulick informed BuzzFeed News that at the end of almost a year of treatment, the aligners have actually ruined her bite: Her front teeth touch prior to her molars can make contact (Smile Direct Club Deals Buy One Get One Free April). ""I'm quite frustrated food is difficult to chew now and they will not fix it!""Gulick said that after complaints to the company, SmileDirectClub accepted continue treatment totally free. When asked about problems that the trays destroyed clients' bites, a SmileDirect representative told BuzzFeed News: ""Over 95% of our consumers complete treatment and sign off on their finished new smile. It's essential to bear in mind that with any orthodontic procedure, bites will continue to shift up until the treatment is finished.""Another consumer, 24 year old Drexel University student Kacie Durham, informed BuzzFeed News that SmileDirectClub sent her a simulated treatment plan that made her teeth look worse.""It actually made my teeth appear more crooked at the bottom,"" she stated. Durham returned her trays and looked for a refund. Later, an orthodontist not connected with the company told her that her teeth would have to be filed and shaped before they might be lined up. Durham felt fooled: SmileDirect had authorized her for a treatment that would never have worked.""If a possible consumer is unhappy with the 3d preview of his/her smile, there is no responsibility to buy aligners,"" the SmileDirectClub representative stated (Smile Direct Club Deals Buy One Get One Free April). Minelle Tendler, a Boca Raton orthodontist, joined one of the greatest Facebook groups, the 11,800 member SmileDirectClub Assistance, after 2 of her patients inquired about the product. In perusing the posts that appear in her Facebook feed, Tendler said that she's not seen anybody say they have actually been able to talk with a dental professional at the company. ""You're asking somebody who has no dental background, 'Is this going to work?'""More than as soon as, Tendler has stopped short of responding to threads on the forum. She rests on her hands since the clients are not hers. ""I'm taking a look at the images and thinking, Oh my god, you need to get teeth taken out, don't do it.""Mostly, she is stressed that individuals who are charmed by SmileDirectClub's low rate aren't completely mindful of the disadvantages of avoiding a dental go to. A previous variation of this post misidentified him as an orthodontist. Align Innovation owns 19% of SmileDirectClub. A previous variation of this story mentioned it was 17%. Likewise, SmileDirectClub started running in North Carolina in early October. A previous variation of this story, based upon an August interview with cofounder Alex Fenkell, stated that the company was not operating in North Carolina. Mail in aligners might seem like an excellent option for a minor fix. However keep in mind you're not the specialist on how minimal a fix your teeth require. ""It's challenging to go from something that's 90% excellent to make it 100% best; in my experience, I discover that these are the harder cases,"" Dr. The outcomes of using unnoticeable aligners can be very unforeseeable, because some individuals react well to them and others will not. ""It's extremely hard to monitor this by yourself, because like everything in medicine not everyone reacts the very same,"" he states. The genuine problem comes with figuring out how to fix your smile if you're not reacting correctly to the retainers, he says. smiledirectreview Copyright © 2021 Beautiful Teeth: Smile Direct | Sitemap | Privacy Policy | Terms and Conditions | Disclaimer policy | Cookie policy | Contact Us",0.9606838

To be eligible this spring, a player must be 10, 11 or 12 years old on April 30 of the current year. A player who turns 10 after May 1, or turns 13 earlier than April 30, is not eligible. League Format The Major A League is a competitive league that emphasizes skill development, team play, and sportsmanship. At this level, players are taught the various positions on the field and the responsibilities of those positions, and all players are given a chance to play different positions over the course of the season. The league is made up of six teams. During the regular season, each team plays two or three games per week — on weeknights (no earlier than 5:30 p.m.) and Sunday afternoons (starting times vary). The regular season is followed by playoffs, which conclude by the final day of the public school year. The playoffs consist of three rounds of best of three game series, and all teams qualify. Regular season and playoff games are scheduled by the league VP. Practices are scheduled by each team's head coach according to coach, player, and field availability. Player Selection/Team Formation A player is assigned to Major A after thorough observation, evaluation, and discussion. Those involved in the decision include: the Major A League and Major B League VPs; members of the BYB Board of Directors who have knowledge of the player; the player's coach during last year's spring, summer, and/or fall season; the player's instructor during any recent BYB clinics he/she attended; and coaches who observed the player at this year's preseason tryout. While the preseason tryout is only one piece of the evaluation process, a player who does not attend a tryout may be less likely to be assigned to Major A. (Note: Players who were on a Major A team last spring and are still age eligible for Major A this spring are not required to attend a tryout. These players are automatically reassigned to the same team in Major A.) As players are selected for Major A, all players of league age 11 or 12 are considered. In general, a 12 year old player is selected ahead of an 11 year old of similar ability; however, a 12 year old is not assigned to Major A based on age alone if the player is likely to be overwhelmed by the higher level of competition. BYB's goal is to place each player at the level where he/she has the best chance for a successful season and a positive baseball experience. Teams are assembled by the Major A League VP, who consults the Major B League VP and Major A coaches. The objective is to construct teams that are comparable in talent so that the competition among them is as balanced as possible. Major A League umpires are adults who are certified and assigned by a professional umpire service, or experienced former BYB players of high school age who have been trained in umpiring. One or two umpires may be assigned for a game. If no assigned umpire arrives by the time the game is scheduled to begin, the two head coaches may, upon mutual agreement, select one or two of those in attendance (including themselves) to umpire the game. Before each game, head coaches must meet with the umpires at home plate to review ground rules and other rules that are unique to BYB's Major A League. During a game, only a head coach may discuss a play with an umpire. The head coach of the home team is responsible for paying the umpire. Bats and Baseballs Only wooden bats are allowed in this league; aluminum bats are not permitted. Wooden bats used in a game must be between 27 and 32 inches in length and no more than 32 ounces in weight. Regulation hard balls are used in all practices and games. Any questions or concerns regarding the Major A League should be directed to the league VP. Questions or concerns about umpiring should be directed to the VP in charge of umpires. See the BYB website (www.brooklineyouthbaseball.org) for a list of VPs and their email addresses. The Major A League uses the official Little League Baseball playing rules as a standard guide, amended by the following game rules. BYB's principal goal is to ensure an atmosphere of sportsmanship and civility. Other objectives, such as winning and personal performance, are secondary. The following Code of Conduct, which is based on these priorities, applies to all BYB games and practices. All players, coaches, and spectators must: Treat other players, coaches, spectators, and umpires with respect. Refrain from: criticizing, insulting, taunting, blaming, or threatening another person; using foul language; and physically abusing another person. Accept the decisions of umpires without complaint. (A head coach may question the application of a rule, but judgment calls may not be argued.) Treat all equipment with care Players must play by the rules of the game and accept coaches' decisions without complaint. Head coaches must monitor the behavior of their players, assistant coaches, and spectators, and must act immediately to put a stop to unsportsmanlike behavior when it occurs. All coaches must follow the rules, treat each player as an individual, recognize and reward effort as well as talent, and promote sportsmanship. Spectators are encouraged to cheer and show appreciation for good plays and efforts made by both teams, and may not challenge or criticize a coach's decision. In the event that a player, coach, or spectator violates BYB's Code of Conduct, both the umpire and the league VP are authorized to dismiss the individual from the field, and to stop the game and declare a forfeit if the individual does not comply. In addition, BYB reserves the right to impose further sanctions, including expulsion from the BYB program (without a refund of registration fees to players or their families). Game Format Major A League games are designed to allow players to apply the skills they've learned during practices. These games are competitive, and scores are recorded. All games are scheduled to last six innings. In the event of inclement weather during the day of a game, head coaches are responsible for contacting each other to determine whether the game can be played. Head coaches are also responsible for calling the Town of Brookline's Recreation Information Line (730 2083 or 730 2084) to find out if the fields are closed because of poor conditions; the recorded message on this line is typically updated by 11:00 a.m. on weekdays and 7:00 a.m. on weekends. Before a game, the head coaches have the authority to decide whether the game can be played (if the fields are open); if the head coaches cannot reach an agreement, the head coach of the home team has final say. Once a game has begun, the umpire has the authority to stop the game due to inclement weather or poor field conditions, after consulting both head coaches. (Note: The most important consideration must be the safety of the players.) Postponements If the two head coaches are unable to reach each other directly, only the home team's head coach may postpone a game on his/her own. In this situation, he/she must immediately leave a voice message notifying both the visiting team's head coach and the league VP of the postponement, or risk losing the game by forfeit. If a game is postponed before the teams have arrived at the field, the home team's head coach must notify the league VP of the postponement as soon as possible so that the league VP has time to notify the coordinator of umpires. (Ideally, the league VP should be notified three hours before the scheduled start time, but this isn't always possible because of sudden changes in the weather.) If the umpire arrives at the field because BYB provided late notice or no notice of a postponement, the home team coach must pay the umpire the full amount. Rescheduling A postponed game must be rescheduled at a later date, time, and location agreed upon by the two head coaches and the league VP. The league VP is responsible for providing an umpire at the rescheduled game. The home team is required to provide bases for each game. Both teams must provide their own bats and batting helmets, although each team must share batting helmets if the other team doesn't have enough. Each team is required to provide two new game balls to the umpire before the start of the game. Before the game, head coaches must meet with the umpire at home plate to review ground rules and other rules that are unique to BYB's Major A League. Coaches and Spectators Coaches are allowed to choose two assistant coaches and a scorekeeper to be in the bench area during games. Only head coaches and assistant coaches are allowed on the field during a break in play to instruct players. Only head coaches, assistant coaches, and players are allowed to coach from the first and third base coaching boxes (players must wear helmets). Only a head coach is allowed to discuss a play with an umpire. Spectators who are not coaches must watch the game in the areas designated for spectators, and are not allowed on the field or in the bench area with the team. No spectator may stand behind the backstop during a game. Fielding a Team A team must be able to field at least eight players to play a game. If a team cannot field at least eight players when the game is scheduled to begin, the start of the game may be delayed for 10 minutes in order to allow late players to arrive. If, after 10 minutes, the team still cannot field at least eight players, that team must forfeit the game. If an injury or early departure leaves a team unable to field at least eight players at any time after a game has begun, that team must forfeit the game. (Note: A shorthanded team may not borrow players from the opposing team.) If a coach knows ahead of time that he/she will not be able to field at least nine players for a game and would like to borrow a player from the Major B League, the coach must first contact the Major A League VP, who will request a player from the Major B League VP. Only a player who does not have a Major B game on the same day is allowed to play in a Major A game. (Note: Major B players may not pitch in a Major A game and must bat at the bottom of the batting order.) During each game, each player must play in the field for at least four innings, except when: The game is stopped prior to six innings of play because of inclement weather, poor field conditions, or darkness. The coach benches a player for disciplinary reasons such as missing games and/or practices without notifying the coach, insubordination, or disruptive behavior. The coach must notify the opposing coach of the disciplinary action before the start of the game. (Note: Poor play is not a valid reason for benching a player.) Each player must sit on the bench for at least one inning per game, except when: Not enough players are available. Each time a coach doesn't have enough players available to comply with the must sit requirement, he/she must allow a different player to play a complete game. No player, except a catcher (see the next bullet), may play two complete games until each player on the team has played one complete game. An injury to or absence of a player leaves no back up catcher available. In this case, the coach may keep the same player at the catcher position for the entire game. The coach must inform the opposing coach of the injury or absence prior to the game or immediately when the injury occurs. (Note: Only an injury to or absence of all back up catchers permits one player to catch an entire game, and each team must have at least two catchers to help prevent this situation.) A pitcher may not pitch more than five innings in a game under any circumstances. Substitutions and Mound Visits As long as playing time requirements are met, players may be freely substituted throughout the game — except at pitcher. All fielding changes, except pitching changes and substitutions due to injury, must be made at the start of an inning. No fielding substitutions may be made in the middle of an inning unless it involves a pitcher switching places with another fielder. A ""mound visit"" occurs any time an umpire calls time out to allow a coach to speak with the pitcher, or to speak with a position player who then speaks with the pitcher before the next pitch. Coaches are allowed one free mound visit per inning to speak with each pitcher. A second mound visit to the same pitcher in the same inning requires the coach to replace the pitcher. (Note: If a coach replaces a pitcher during a mound visit and speaks with the new pitcher before leaving the mound, the visit does not count as a mound visit to the new pitcher.) A pitcher who is removed from the mound may not re enter the game as a pitcher, but may re enter the game at another position. Other infielders (but not outfielders) may huddle with the coach on the mound during mound visits. However, the umpire may direct the players back to their positions and the coach back to the bench if, in the umpire's opinion, the game is being delayed unnecessarily. The on deck batter may not hold a bat while waiting in the on deck area. All players who are not at bat or on deck must remain on the bench at all times, unless warming up to pitch. Pitchers must warm up away from the bench area: down the foul line, in foul territory, adjacent to the outfield nearest their bench. Spectators who are not coaches must watch the game in the areas designated for spectators, and are not allowed on the field or in the bench area with the team. No player, coach, or spectator may stand behind the backstop during a game. The following pitching rules are in force during the regular season, and in the playoffs unless adjusted by the league VP. If the league VP adjusts these rules for the playoffs, he/she will inform the league's head coaches before the playoffs begin. These restrictions are designed to protect pitchers' throwing arms from overuse. A team that violates a pitching rule is subject to disciplinary action, which may include forfeiture of the game in which the violation occurred and/or suspension of the coach. Innings Limit Maximum innings for each pitcher: Per game: 5 Per pitching week (Sunday Saturday): 6 Important notes about innings limits: Any inning in which a pitcher throws at least one pitch to a batter counts as a full inning for that pitcher. If a game is stopped before it has become an official game, the innings pitched still count toward each pitcher's total innings for the week. Rest Requirements The following rest requirements remain in force even when a new pitching week has begun (in other words, the start of a new pitching week does not eliminate the rest requirement). Note that players may not pitch on consecutive days. Innings Pitched in a Game Full Calendar Days of Rest Required Example 1 3 1 A player who pitches 4 innings on Friday may not pitch again until Tuesday. A player who pitches three innings on Sunday may not pitch again until Tuesday. A player who pitches four innings on Sunday may not pitch again until Thursday. Pitch Limits In addition to abiding by the mandatory innings limits and rest requirements, each head coach must record the number of pitches thrown by each pitcher on his/her team during each game, and must report each pitcher's pitch count to the league VP after the game. Coaches are expected to limit the number of pitches each pitcher throws according to the pitch maximums in the following table, and to verify ongoing pitch counts with the opposing coach after each half inning. BYB reserves the right to discipline any coach who allows a pitcher to exceed these limits. Pitches per Day Pitches per Week Before May 18 60 80 On or After May 18 80 100 Prohibited Pitches Any pitch that entails the snapping or turning of the wrist — such as a Curveball or Slider — is prohibited. When done incorrectly or too often, this type of delivery is likely to lead to forearm and elbow injuries. The intent of this rule is not to keep a player from throwing a pitch that changes direction, but to keep him/her from snapping or turning the wrist during the delivery of the pitch. Therefore, a pitch that changes direction but does not entail snapping or turning the wrist, such as a Two Seam Fastball or a Circle Change Up, is allowed. (Note: Head coaches are responsible for ensuring that the umpire is aware of this rule before the game begins.) If a pitcher snaps or turns the wrist during delivery, the umpire must issue a warning to the pitcher. If the batter swings at and misses the pitch or hits into an out, the pitch is called a ball and the batter continues his/her at bat; however, if the batter hits the ball and reaches base safely, he/she may remain on base. Upon a second violation of the rule by the same pitcher, the pitcher must be removed from the mound but may remain in the game at another position. Balks are not called. Intentional walks are allowed only if first base is open and there are less than two outs. A pitcher who hits two batters in an inning or three in a game must be removed from the mound. A pitcher who is removed from the mound may not re enter the game as a pitcher, but may remain in or re enter the game at another position. Each player at this position must wear a complete set of catcher's equipment: helmet, face mask, throat guard, chest protector, catcher's mitt, shin guards, and protective cup. If a catcher, when his/her team is batting, reaches base or is on base with two outs in an inning, the coach has the option to temporarily replace the catcher with a pinch runner so that the catcher can begin putting on the catcher's equipment. This rule is designed to allow the next half inning to begin without delay, and applies only if the catcher will return to the catcher position. The pinch runner must be the player who made the most recent out. Each batter must wear a helmet in the on deck area and throughout the at bat. Batting Order Each team must provide the opposing team's scorekeeper with a batting order before the game. With the exception of players who become injured or leave the field early, all players must remain in the same spot in the order throughout the game — even when not playing in the field. If a player must be removed from the order because of injury or early departure, the removal must be reported to the opposing scorekeeper and the player's spot in the order may be skipped for the rest of the game without an out being recorded. Players who arrive after the game has begun must be added to the end of the order and reported to the opposing scorekeeper immediately. When a player fails to bat in his/her proper spot in the order: If the mistake is detected and pointed out by either head coach before the at bat is completed, the improper batter is replaced by the proper batter, who inherits any balls and strikes that had already been called. If the head coach of the fielding team appeals to the umpire after the improper batter has concluded the at bat but before the first pitch to the next batter, the proper batter (the one who failed to bat in turn) is called out. In this case, the improper batter may not remain on base, any advances by base runners that resulted from a ball hit into play by the improper batter are nullified, and the batting order resumes with the batter who would normally bat after the proper batter, even if it's the same batter who just batted improperly. If the head coach of the fielding team appeals after the first pitch to the next batter, the improper batter remains on base, no batter is called out, base runner advances are not nullified, and the batting order resumes with the batter who would normally bat after the improper batter. BUNTS/SACRIFICE FLIES/DROPPED THIRD STRIKES Bunting is allowed; a bunt into foul territory after the batter already has two strikes is a strike out. Sacrifice fly balls, in which a base runner tags up and advances to the next base after the ball is caught, are allowed. A batter may not advance to first base on a wild pitch or passed ball on a third strike. Infield Fly/Hidden Ball The Infield Fly Rule is enforced in this league, and applies only when all of the following conditions are met: An infield pop up is in fair territory and, in the umpire's opinion, can be caught by an infielder with ordinary effort. There are base runners on first and second bases or the bases are loaded. There are less than two outs. When calling the Infield Fly Rule, the umpire calls the batter out whether or not the ball is caught, and the base runners may tag up/advance at their own risk. BYB does not allow hidden ball plays designed to deceive base runners at any level of play. Base Runners Each base runner must wear a helmet until he/she returns to the bench. Leading and Stealing Leading is not allowed in this league. A player who takes a lead must receive a warning on the first offense and be called out on the second offense. Stealing is allowed, but the base runner may not leave the base until the ball crosses home plate. If a base runner leaves a base early and steals successfully, the base runner must return to the base where he/she started; however, if a base runner leaves a base early and is thrown out trying to steal, the base runner is out. Base runners may not advance if the pitcher is standing on any part of the mound with the ball. A base runner may not intentionally make contact with a fielder. A base runner who, in the umpire's opinion, initiates contact with a fielder anywhere on the base paths may be called out. To prevent collisions, a base runner approaching second base, third base, or home plate must slide feet first if a throw is made in an attempt to get the base runner out — even if the throw is late or off target. A base runner who does not slide may be called out by the umpire if the base runner makes contact with a fielder. A base runner who slides head first when advancing to a base may be called out by the umpire. Head first slides are permitted only when a base runner is diving back to a base to avoid being doubled off on a line drive or to avoid being picked off. (Note: A base runner may not slide when advancing to first base.) Plays at Home Plate Advancing on Overthrows If a fielder causes a ball to leave the playing field — beyond the backstop or the side boundaries (usually the team benches) agreed upon before the game — each base runner is awarded the base he/she is going to plus one additional base. When the ball is within the playing field, base runners advance at their own risk. Pinch Runners Mercy Rule An inning must end when the batting team scores 10 runs or the fielding team makes three outs, whichever occurs first. The 10 run rule, however, does not apply during the final inning of play. The inning is not over after a team bats around the order — only after 10 runs have been scored. If the score is tied after six innings, play continues until one team has more total runs than the other after the bottom half of an extra inning. If the score is still tied when darkness, weather, or the scheduled start of another game causes the game to be stopped: If it's a regular season game, the game is complete and considered a tie. If it's a playoff game, the game must be concluded at a later date, time, and location agreed upon by the two head coaches and the league VP. Prior to May 15, an inning may not be started after 7:30 p.m. After that date, an inning may not be started after 7:50 p.m. If, in the umpire's opinion, after consulting both head coaches, an inning is unlikely to be completed in daylight, the game must be stopped before the start of that inning. Under no circumstances may a game be continued when it's difficult for any player to see the ball. The umpire is authorized to stop a game because of darkness at any time. If a game is official and is stopped in the middle of an inning, the score reverts to what it was at the end of the last completed inning. Official Game A game is considered official after two and a half innings have been played when the home team is leading, or after three full innings otherwise. Partial Game If a game must be discontinued because of inclement weather, poor field conditions, or darkness before it becomes an official game, it must be resumed at a later date, time, and location agreed upon by the two head coaches and the league VP. Resumed Game A partial game that's resumed must continue from the exact point where it left off: the same half of the same inning, with the same batter, batting orders, base runners, pitchers, and fielders. Partial game players who are unavailable for the resumed game may be replaced by other available players who were not in the field or in the lineup when the partial game was stopped. However, a pitcher who had been removed from the partial game before it was stopped may not pitch in the resumed game. The league VP is responsible for providing an umpire at the resumed game. The winner and score of the game (the score of a forfeit is recorded as 6 0) The number of innings played The numbers of innings pitched by each pitcher for both teams Rule Violations, Disputes, and Protests A coach who notices that the opposing team is about to violate a rule (such as a playing time rule) must notify the opposing coach immediately. It is not acceptable to wait until the rule has been violated in an attempt to win by forfeit; this is not consistent with the spirit of youth baseball or the objectives of BYB If a rule violation has occurred: The head coach who observes the violation should first bring it to the attention of the opposing head coach and, if possible, resolve the issue without involving the umpire. If the issue cannot be resolved between the two head coaches, they must then consult the umpire. For certain violations, such as batting out of order or use of an illegal bat, the umpire must be notified immediately after the conclusion of the at bat in which the violation occurred, before the first pitch to the next batter (see BATTING ORDER for more details). After the umpire makes a decision to resolve the dispute, the coaches must abide by that decision and must resume play and complete the game. The umpire has final authority while the game is in progress, and his or her decision cannot be reversed during the course of the game without his or her consent. If a head coach disagrees with the umpire's decision and wants to elevate the issue to the league VP, he or she must: Formally protest the game before resuming play. To do this, the coach must write the word ""protest"" in his or her scorebook, record the game details at the time of the protest (inning, score, outs, base runners), and have the umpire sign the score book. Any other form of protest, such as refusing to resume play (except when the safety of the players is compromised), is not allowed and may result in a forfeit against the protesting team and further discipline against that team's head coach. Contact the league VP within two hours after the conclusion of the game to complete the protest. The league VP will then take whatever steps are necessary to resolve the dispute fairly, and will make a decision that may include allowing the final score to stand, replaying some or all of the game, or awarding a forfeit to overturn the outcome of the game. Note: A coach may not protest a game after the conclusion of the game without following the protest process described above. Therefore, any rule violation or dispute that is not brought to the attention of the opposing head coach and the umpire while the game is in progress cannot be used as grounds for a protest after the game has ended. Standings are determined using each team's Total Points (win = two points; tie = one point). The top two seeds at the end of the regular season receive a bye in the first round of the playoffs. If two teams are tied, the following tie breakers are applied in the order shown: Winning Percentage (ties are ignored in calculating winning percentage) Win/Loss Record: head to head Runs Scored minus Runs Allowed: head to head Win/Loss Record: versus the next best seed Runs Scored minus Runs Allowed: versus the next best seed","THESE RULES HAVE BEEN SUPERSEDED. PLEASE CLICK ON ""Rules/Docs"" FOR THE CURRENT MAJOR B RULES MAJOR B LEAGUE RULES The Major B League is one of two Major League levels in Brookline Youth Baseball (BYB). To be eligible this spring, a player must be 10, 11, or 12 years old on August 31 of this year. A player who turns 10 in September or later, or turns 13 in August or earlier, is not eligible. League Format The Major B League is a competitive league that emphasizes skill development, team play, and sportsmanship. At this level, players are taught the various positions on the field and the responsibilities of those positions, and all players are given a chance to play different positions over the course of the season. The number of teams and number of players on each team are determined by the league vice president (VP), along with members of the BYB Board of Directors, based on registration numbers. During the regular season, each team plays two games per week — on weeknights (no earlier than 5:30 p.m.) and Sunday afternoons (starting times vary). The regular season is followed by playoffs,which conclude by the final day of the public school year. The playoff format is determined by the league VP, and all teams qualify. Regular season and playoff games are scheduled by the league VP. Practices are scheduled by each team's head coach according to coach, player, and field availability. Player Selection/Team Formation A player is assigned to Major B after thorough observation, evaluation, and discussion. Those involved in the decision include: the Major B League, Major A League, and Minor League VPs; members of the BYB Board of Directors who have knowledge of the player; the player's coach during last year's spring, summer, and/or fall season; the player's instructor during any recent BYB clinics he/she attended; and coaches who observed the player at this year's preseason tryout. BYB's goal is to place each player at the level where he/she has the best chance for a successful season and a positive baseball experience. Teams are assembled by the Major B League VP, who consults the Minor League VPs and Major B coaches. The objective is to construct teams that are comparable in talent so that the competition among them is as balanced as possible. Major B League umpires are usually current or former BYB players, between ages 13 and 17, who have been trained in umpiring. If no assigned umpire arrives by the time the game is scheduled to begin, the two head coaches may, upon mutual agreement, select one or two of those in attendance (including themselves) to umpire the game. Before each game, head coaches must meet with the umpire at home plate to review ground rules and other rules that are unique to BYB's Major B League. During a game, only a head coach may discuss a play with an umpire. The head coach of the home team is responsible for paying the umpire. Bats and Baseballs Only wooden bats are allowed in this league; aluminum bats are not permitted. Wooden bats used in a game must be between 27 and 32 inches in length and no more than 32 ounces in weight. Regulation hard balls are used in all practices and games. Any questions or concerns regarding the Major B League should be directed to the league VP. Questions or concerns about umpiring should be directed to the VP in charge of umpires. See the BYB website (www.brooklineyouthbaseball.org) for a list of VPs and their email addresses. The Major B League uses the official Little League Baseball playing rules as a standard guide, amended by the following game rules. Violation of any rule may result in forfeiture of a game, ejection from a game, and/or suspension or expulsion from BYB. BYB's principal goal is to ensure an atmosphere of sportsmanship and civility. Other objectives, such as winning and personal performance, are secondary. The following Code of Conduct, which is based on these priorities, applies to all BYB games and practices. All players, coaches, and spectators must: Treat other players, coaches, spectators, and umpires with respect. Refrain from: criticizing, insulting, taunting, blaming, or threatening another person; using foul language; and physically abusing another person. Accept the decisions of umpires without complaint. (A head coach may question the application of a rule, but judgment calls may not be argued.) Treat all equipment with care. In addition: Players must play by the rules of the game and accept coaches' decisions without complaint. Head coaches must monitor the behavior of their players, assistant coaches, and spectators, and must act immediately to put a stop to unsportsmanlike behavior when it occurs. All coaches must follow the rules, treat each player as an individual, recognize and reward effort as well as talent, and promote sportsmanship. Spectators are encouraged to cheer and show appreciation for good plays and efforts made by both teams, and may not challenge or criticize a coach's decision. In the event that a player, coach, or spectator violates BYB's Code of Conduct, both the umpire and the league VP are authorized to dismiss the individual from the field, and to stop the game and declare a forfeit if the individual does not comply. In addition, BYB reserves the right to impose further sanctions, including expulsion from the BYB program (without a refund of registration fees to players or their families). Game Format Major B League games are designed to allow players to apply the skills they've learned during practices. These games are competitive, and scores are recorded. All games are scheduled to last six innings. In the event of inclement weather during the day of a game, head coaches are responsible for contacting each other to determine whether the game can be played. Head coaches are also responsible for calling the Town of Brookline's Recreation Information Line (730 2083 or 730 2084) to find out if the fields are closed because of poor conditions; the recorded message on this line is typically updated by 11:00 a.m. on weekdays and 7:00 a.m. on weekends. Before a game, the head coaches have the authority to decide whether the game can be played (if the fields are open); if the head coaches cannot reach an agreement, the head coach of the home team has final say. Once a game has begun, the umpire has the authority to stop the game due to inclement weather or poor field conditions, after consulting both head coaches. (Note: The most important consideration must be the safety of the players.) Postponements If the two head coaches are unable to reach each other directly, only the home team's head coach may postpone a game on his/her own. In this situation, he/she must immediately leave a voice message notifying both the visiting team's head coach and the league VP of the postponement, or risk losing the game by forfeit. If a game is postponed before the teams have arrived at the field, the home team's head coach must notify the league VP of the postponement as soon as possible so that the league VP has time to notify the coordinator of umpires. (Ideally, the league VP should be notified three hours before the scheduled start time, but this isn't always possible because of sudden changes in the weather.) If the umpire arrives at the field because BYB provided late notice or no notice of a postponement, the home team coach must pay the umpire the full amount. A postponed game must be rescheduled at a later date, time, and location agreed upon by the two head coaches and the league VP. The league VP is responsible for providing an umpire at the rescheduled game. Game Equipment The home team is required to provide bases for each game. Both teams must provide their own bats and batting helmets, although each team must share batting helmets if the other team doesn't have enough. Each team is required to provide a new game ball to the umpire before the start of the game. Before each game, head coaches must meet with the umpire at home plate to review ground rules and other rules that are unique to BYB's Major B League. Coaches and Spectators Coaches are allowed to choose two assistant coaches and a scorekeeper to be in the bench area during games. Only head coaches and assistant coaches are allowed on the field during a break in play to instruct players. Only head coaches, assistant coaches, and players are allowed to coach from the first and third base coaching boxes (players must wear helmets). Only a head coach is allowed to discuss a play with an umpire. Spectators who are not coaches must watch the game in the areas designated for spectators, and are not allowed on the field or in the bench area with the team. No spectator may stand behind the backstop during a game. Fielding a Team A team must be able to field at least eight players to play a game. If a team cannot field at least eight players when the game is scheduled to begin, the start of the game may be delayed for 10 minutes in order to allow late players to arrive. If, after 10 minutes, the team still cannot field at least eight players, that team must forfeit the game. If an injury or early departure leaves a team unable to field at least eight players at any time after a game has begun, that team must forfeit the game. (Note: A shorthanded team may not borrow players from the opposing team.) If a coach knows ahead of time that he/she will not be able to field at least nine players for a game and would like to borrow a player from the Minor League, the coach must first contact the Major B League VP, who will request a player from a Minor League VP. Only a player who does not have a Minor League game on the same day is allowed to play in a Major B game. (Note: Minor League players may not pitch in a Major B game and must bat at the bottom of the batting order.) During each game, each player must play in the field for at least four innings and must be allowed to play positions in the infield and the outfield, except when: The game is stopped prior to six innings of play because of inclement weather, poor field conditions, or darkness. The coach benches a player for disciplinary reasons such as missing games and/or practices without notifying the coach, insubordination, or disruptive behavior. The coach must notify the opposing coach of the disciplinary action before the start of the game. (Note: Poor play is not a valid reason for benching a player.) Each player must sit on the bench for at least one inning per game, except when: Not enough players are available. Each time a coach doesn't have enough players available to comply with the must sit requirement, he/she must allow a different player to play a complete game. No player, except a catcher (see the next bullet), may play two complete games until each player on the team has played one complete game. An injury to or absence of a player leaves no back up catcher available. In this case, the coach may keep the same player at the catcher position for the entire game. The coach must inform the opposing coach of the injury or absence prior to the game or immediately when the injury occurs. (Note: Only an injury to or absence of all back up catchers permits one player to catch an entire game, and each team must have at least two catchers to help prevent this situation.) A pitcher may not pitch more than four innings in a game under any circumstances. Substitutions and Mound Visits As long as playing time requirements are met, players may be freely substituted throughout the game — except at pitcher. All fielding changes, except pitching changes and substitutions due to injury, must be made at the start of an inning. No fielding substitutions may be made in the middle of an inning unless it involves a pitcher switching places with another fielder. A ""mound visit"" occurs any time an umpire calls time out to allow a coach to speak with the pitcher, or to speak with a position player who then speaks with the pitcher before the next pitch. Coaches are allowed one free mound visit per inning to speak with each pitcher. A second mound visit to the same pitcher in the same inning requires the coach to replace the pitcher. (Note: If a coach replaces a pitcher during a mound visit and speaks with the new pitcher before leaving the mound, the visit does not count as a mound visit to the new pitcher.) A pitcher who is removed from the mound may not re enter the game as a pitcher, but may re enter the game at another position. Other infielders (but not outfielders) may huddle with the coach on the mound during mound visits. However, the umpire may direct the players back to their positions and the coach back to the bench if, in the umpire's opinion, the game is being delayed unnecessarily. Bench Area The on deck batter may not hold a bat while waiting in the on deck area. All players who are not at bat or on deck must remain on the bench at all times, unless warming up to pitch. Pitchers must warm up away from the bench area: down the foul line, in foul territory, adjacent to the outfield nearest their bench. Spectators who are not coaches must watch the game in the areas designated for spectators, and are not allowed on the field or in the bench area with the team. No player, coach, or spectator may stand behind the backstop during a game. The following pitching rules are in force during the regular season, and in the playoffs unless adjusted by the league VP. If the league VP adjusts these rules for the playoffs, he/she will inform the league's head coaches before the playoffs begin. These restrictions are designed to protect pitchers' throwing arms from overuse. A team that violates a pitching rule is subject to disciplinary action, which may include forfeiture of the game in which the violation occurred and/or suspension of the coach. Maximum innings for each pitcher: Per game: 5 Per pitching week (Sunday Saturday): 6 Important notes about innings limits: Any inning in which a pitcher throws at least one pitch to a batter counts as a full inning for that pitcher. If a game is stopped before it has become an official game, the innings pitched still count toward each pitcher's total innings for the week. Rest Requirements The following rest requirements remain in force even when a new pitching week has begun (in other words, the start of a new pitching week does not eliminate the rest requirement). Note that players may not pitch on consecutive days. Innings Pitched in a Game Full Calendar Days of Rest Required Example 1 3 1 A player who pitches 4 innings on Friday may not pitch again until Tuesday. Pitch Limits In addition to abiding by the mandatory innings limits and rest requirements, each head coach must record the number of pitches thrown by each pitcher on his/her team during each game, and must report each pitcher's pitch count to the league VP after the game. Coaches are expected to limit the number of pitches each pitcher throws according to the pitch maximums in the following table, and to verify ongoing pitch counts with the opposing coach after each half inning. BYB reserves the right to discipline any coach who allows a pitcher to exceed these limits. Pitches per Day Pitches per Week Before May 18 60 80 On or After May 18 80 100 Prohibited Pitches Any pitch that entails the snapping or turning of the wrist — such as a Curveball or Slider — is prohibited. When done incorrectly or too often, this type of delivery is likely to lead to forearm and elbow injuries. The intent of this rule is not to keep a player from throwing a pitch that changes direction, but to keep him/her from snapping or turning the wrist during the delivery of the pitch. Therefore, a pitch that changes direction but does not entail snapping or turning the wrist, such as a Two Seam Fastball or a Circle Change Up, is allowed. (Note: Head coaches are responsible for ensuring that the umpire is aware of this rule before the game begins.) If a pitcher snaps or turns the wrist during delivery, the umpire must issue a warning to the pitcher. If the batter swings at and misses the pitch or hits into an out, the pitch is called a ball and the batter continues his/her at bat; however, if the batter hits the ball and reaches base safely, he/she may remain on base. Upon a second violation of the rule by the same pitcher, the pitcher must be removed from the mound but may remain in the game at another position. Balks are not called. Intentional walks are allowed only if first base is open and there are less than two outs. A pitcher who hits two batters in an inning or three in a game must be removed from the mound. A pitcher who is removed from the mound may not re enter the game as a pitcher, but may remain in or re enter the game at another position. Each player at this position must wear a complete set of catcher's equipment: helmet, face mask, throat guard, chest protector, catcher's mitt, shin guards, and protective cup. If a catcher, when his/her team is batting, reaches base or is on base with two outs in an inning, the coach has the option to temporarily replace the catcher with a pinch runner so that the catcher can begin putting on the catcher's equipment. This rule is designed to allow the next half inning to begin without delay, and applies only if the catcher will return to the catcher position. The pinch runner must be the player who made the most recent out. Each batter must wear a helmet in the on deck area and throughout the at bat. Batting Order Each team must provide the opposing team's scorekeeper with a batting order before the game. With the exception of players who become injured or leave the field early, all players must remain in the same spot in the order throughout the game — even when not playing in the field. If a player must be removed from the order because of injury or early departure, the removal must be reported to the opposing scorekeeper and the player's spot in the order may be skipped for the rest of the game without an out being recorded. Players who arrive after the game has begun must be added to the end of the order and reported to the opposing scorekeeper immediately. When a player fails to bat in his/her proper spot in the order: If the mistake is detected and pointed out by either head coach before the at bat is completed, the improper batter is replaced by the proper batter, who inherits any balls and strikes that had already been called. If the head coach of the fielding team appeals to the umpire after the improper batter has concluded the at bat but before the first pitch to the next batter, the proper batter (the one who failed to bat in turn) is called out. In this case, the improper batter may not remain on base, any advances by base runners that resulted from a ball hit into play by the improper batter are nullified, and the batting order resumes with the batter who would normally bat after the proper batter, even if it's the same batter who just batted improperly. If the head coach of the fielding team appeals after the first pitch to the next batter, the improper batter remains on base, no batter is called out, base runner advances are not nullified, and the batting order resumes with the batter who would normally bat after the improper batter. Bunts/Sacrifice Flies/Dropped third Strikes Bunting is allowed; a bunt into foul territory after the batter already has two strikes is a strike out. Sacrifice fly balls, in which a base runner tags up and advances to the next base after the ball is caught, are allowed. A batter may not advance to first base on a wild pitch or passed ball on a third strike. Infield Fly/Hidden Ball The Infield Fly Rule is not enforced in this league. If a pop up is dropped in the infield, base runners may advance and fielders may record a force out. However, in the best interest of sportsmanship and fair play, coaches may not teach their infielders to purposely drop pop ups in an attempt to force out a lead runner or create a double play or triple play. If, in the umpire's opinion, a fielder purposely drops a pop up: All base runners, including the batter, are allowed to advance one base. The fielding team's head coach must explain the rule to his/her players. The umpire must report the incident to the league VP. BYB does not allow hidden ball plays designed to deceive base runners at any level of play. Base Runners Each base runner must wear a helmet until he/she returns to the bench. Leading and Stealing Leading is not allowed in this league. A player who takes a lead must receive a warning on the first offense and be called out on the second offense. Stealing of second base and third base is allowed, but the base runner may not leave the base until the ball crosses home plate. If a base runner leaves a base early and steals successfully, the base runner must return to the base where he/she started; however, if a base runner leaves a base early and is thrown out trying to steal, the base runner is out. Base runners may not advance if the pitcher is standing on any part of the mound with the ball. Base runners may lead off of first and second base after the ball passes the batter. Base runners are prohibited from leading off of third base at any time. A base runner may not steal home plate or advance from third base to home plate on a wild pitch or passed ball. If a base runner is on third base when the pitcher delivers a pitch, he or she may advance to home plate only if the ball is put in play by the batter. Clarification: A base runner at third base may not advance from third base to home plate on an attempted put out of a runner stealing second base, an attempted pick off of any base runner, or an errant return throw from the catcher to the pitcher. Clarification: A base runner on first base attempts a steal of second base and the catcher throws the ball into the outfield. The runner then attempts to take third base and the center fielder throws the ball out of play attempting to make the out at third base. The base runner is now entitled to home plate because the runner was not on third base when the pitcher delivered the pitch. Sliding/Avoiding Contact A base runner may not intentionally make contact with a fielder. A base runner who, in the umpire's opinion, initiates contact with a fielder anywhere on the base paths may be called out. To prevent collisions, a base runner approaching second base, third base, or home plate must slide feet first if a throw is made in an attempt to get the base runner out — even if the throw is late or off target. A base runner who does not slide may be called out by the umpire if the base runner makes contact with a fielder. A base runner who slides head first when advancing to a base may be called out by the umpire. Head first slides are permitted only when a base runner is diving back to a base to avoid being doubled off on a line drive or to avoid being picked off. (Note: A base runner may not slide when advancing to first base.) Advancing on Throws If a fielder causes a ball to leave the playing field — beyond the backstop or the side boundaries (usually the team benches) agreed upon before the game — each base runner is awarded the base he/she is going to plus one additional base. When the ball is within the playing field, base runners advance at their own risk. Pinch Runners Mercy Rule An inning must end when the batting team scores 10 runs or the fielding team makes three outs, whichever occurs first. The 10 run rule, however, does not apply during the final inning of play. The inning is not over after a team bats around the order — only after 10 runs have been scored. If the score is tied after six innings, play continues until one team has more total runs than the other after the bottom half of an extra inning. If the score is still tied when darkness, weather, or the scheduled start of another game causes the game to be stopped: If it's a regular season game, the game is complete and considered a tie. If it's a playoff game, the game must be concluded at a later date, time, and location agreed upon by the two head coaches and the league VP. Prior to May 15, an inning may not be started after 7:30 p.m. After that date, an inning may not be started after 7:50 p.m. If, in the umpire's opinion, after consulting both head coaches, an inning is unlikely to be completed in daylight, the game must be stopped before the start of that inning. Under no circumstances may a game be continued when it's difficult for any player to see the ball. The umpire is authorized to stop a game because of darkness at any time. If a game is official and is stopped in the middle of an inning, the score reverts to what it was at the end of the last completed inning. Official Game A game is considered official after two and a half innings have been played when the home team is leading, or after three full innings otherwise. Partial Game If a game must be discontinued because of inclement weather, poor field conditions, or darkness before it becomes an official game, it must be resumed at a later date, time, and location agreed upon by the two head coaches and the league VP. Resumed Game A partial game that's resumed must continue from the exact point where it left off: the same half of the same inning, with the same batter, batting orders, base runners, pitchers, and fielders. Partial game players who are unavailable for the resumed game may be replaced by other available players who were not in the field or in the lineup when the partial game was stopped. However, a pitcher who had been removed from the partial game before it was stopped may not pitch in the resumed game. The league VP is responsible for providing an umpire at the resumed game. Game Recording and Reporting Each team is required to keep score. Coaches/scorekeepers should meet after each half inning to ensure that they agree on the score, and to notify each other of lineup changes and substitutions. The head coach of the winning team (or the home team if the game ends in a tie) is responsible for reporting the following to the league VP within 24 hours after the game: The winner and score of the game (the score of a forfeit is recorded as 6 0) The number of innings played The numbers of innings pitched by each pitcher for both teams Each head coach should also report any inappropriate behavior by coaches, players, or spectators. Rule Violations, Disputes, and Protests A coach who notices that the opposing team is about to violate a rule (such as a playing time rule) must notify the opposing coach immediately. It is not acceptable to wait until the rule has been violated in an attempt to win by forfeit; this is not consistent with the spirit of youth baseball or the objectives of BYB. If a rule violation has occurred: The head coach who observes the violation should first bring it to the attention of the opposing head coach and, if possible, resolve the issue without involving the umpire. If the issue cannot be resolved between the two head coaches, they must then consult the umpire. For certain violations, such as batting out of order or use of an illegal bat, the umpire must be notified immediately after the conclusion of the at bat in which the violation occurred, before the first pitch to the next batter (see BATTING ORDER for more details). After the umpire makes a decision to resolve the dispute, the coaches must abide by that decision and must resume play and complete the game. The umpire has final authority while the game is in progress, and his or her decision cannot be reversed during the course of the game without his or her consent. If a head coach disagrees with the umpire's decision and wants to elevate the issue to the league VP, he or she must: Formally protest the game before resuming play. To do this, the coach must write the word ""protest"" in his or her scorebook, record the game details at the time of the protest (inning, score, outs, base runners), and have the umpire sign the score book. Any other form of protest, such as refusing to resume play (except when the safety of the players is compromised), is not allowed and may result in a forfeit against the protesting team and further discipline against that team's head coach. Contact the league VP within two hours after the conclusion of the game to complete the protest. The league VP will then take whatever steps are necessary to resolve the dispute fairly, and will make a decision that may include allowing the final score to stand, replaying some or all of the game, or awarding a forfeit to overturn the outcome of the game. Note: A coach may not protest a game after the conclusion of the game without following the protest process described above. Therefore, any rule violation or dispute that is not brought to the attention of the opposing head coach and the umpire while the game is in progress cannot be used as grounds for a protest after the game has ended. Standings and Playoff Seedings Standings are determined using each team's Total Points (win = two points; tie = one point). If two teams are tied, the following tie breakers are applied in the order shown: Winning Percentage (ties are ignored in calculating winning percentage) Win/Loss Record: head to head Runs Scored minus Runs Allowed: head to head Win/Loss Record: versus the next best seed Runs Scored minus Runs Allowed: versus the next best seed",0.94881237

The theft highlights the vulnerabilities in trading an asset that global policymakers are struggling to regulate and the broader risks for Japan as it aims to leverage the fintech industry to stimulate economic growth. The Financial Services Agency yesterday ordered improvements to operations at Tokyo based Coincheck, which on Friday suspended trading in all cryptocurrencies except bitcoin after hackers stole 58 billion yen (US$534 million) of NEM coins, among the most popular digital currencies in the world. Coincheck said on Sunday it would return about 90 percent with internal funds, though it has yet to figure out how or when. The NEM coins were stored in a ""hot wallet"" instead of the more secure ""cold wallet,"" which operates on platforms not directly connected to the Internet, Coincheck said. It also does not use an extra layer of security known as a multi signature system. The hack has drawn into focus Japan's approach to regulating cryptocurrency exchanges. Last year, it became the first country to regulate exchanges at the national level — a move that won praise for boosting innovation and protecting consumers, and that contrasts sharply with crackdowns in South Korea and China. The FSA said it ordered Coincheck to submit a report on the hack and measures for preventing a recurrence by February 13, and that it will, if necessary, conduct on site inspections of other cryptocurrency exchanges. It also said it has yet to confirm whether Coincheck had sufficient funds for the reimbursement. But the FSA does not have any rules banning the use of ""hot wallets"" by exchanges, nor does it set requirements on how much should be kept in ""cold wallets,"" an FSA official said at a briefing. In response to FSA's order for improvements, Coincheck said in a statement that it would promptly strengthen its customer protection and governance, and develop its risk management systems. Japan started to require cryptocurrency exchange operators to register with the government only in April 2017, allowing pre existing operators such as Coincheck to continue offering services ahead of formal registration. The FSA has registered 16 cryptocurrency exchanges so far, and another 16 are still awaiting clearance. Coincheck's application was made in September. ""It's been long said that cryptocurrencies are a solid system but cryptocurrency exchanges are not,"" said Makoto Sakuma, research fellow at NLI Research Institute. ""This incident showed that the problem has not been solved at all. If Coincheck screws up its crisis management, that could deal a blow to the current cryptocurrency fever.""","Japan's Financial Watchdog Orders Coincheck Improvements Following $500 Million Hack By Rebecca Campbell Following the hack of Japanese digital currency exchange Coincheck, the country's financial watchdog has sent the exchange a business improvement order to ensure the industry's security. Last Friday, it was reported that Coincheck had halted client withdrawals without any explanation, giving rise to speculation that the exchange had been hacked. It was later revealed that over $500 million worth of XEM the token for the NEM network had been stolen by hackers, resulting in the biggest crypto theft in history. Now, according to an update from Coincheck, Japan's Financial Services Agency (FSA), has ordered improvements. The exchange is to submit a report to the watchdog by the 13th February on the hack and measures to prevent a recurrence. The watchdog is also considering an on site inspection and is expected to inspect all cryptocurrency exchanges. Since the news of the hack came to light Coincheck has vowed to reimburse customers their lost money; however, Japanese authorities have raised questions as to whether the exchange has enough funds to cover the theft. According to a report from the Financial Times, Coincheck said it would reimburse 260,000 customers, however, it has yet to demonstrate how and when it plans to do this. The FSA claim that the exchange only has balance sheet details for September and that it is seeking more up to date information. ""I hear from the FSA they will put maximum effort into helping Coincheck's customers, including the return of their money,"" said Yoshihide Suga, Japan's chief cabinet secretary. ""I think the FSA will be making sure Coincheck handles this in line with the law and its contractual obligations."" According to a report from the Nikkei, it was due to sloppy management at Coincheck, which left customers' money at risk. As a result, the theft of the cryptocurrency made its loss far greater than that of Mt. Gox. Japan is one of the few countries that has authorised and regulated crypto trading. Since April 2017, it has required digital currency operators to register with the government. However, pre existing exchanges such as Coincheck have been permitted to continue offering services ahead of being officially registered. To date, the financial watchdog has registered 16 crypto exchanges, with another 16 waiting for clearance. Singapore based NEM Foundation said in a recent blog that it had a 'full account of all Coincheck's lost XEM on the blockchain.' It added that the hacker had not moved any of the funds to any exchange or personal accounts, but that it had no way of returning the lost funds to customers. coincheck japan NEM Rebecca Campbell Author| Rcampbell@ethereumworldnews.com Rebecca Campbell is a freelance bitcoin and blockchain journalist based in England.

McKinney is working through the series gradually, switching the very first set for the next, and the next, as her teeth move. It'll take about nine months in all. However after three months of using these trays almost every day and night, McKinney is delighted about showing off her brand new smile (Smile Direct Club Deals Buy One Get One Free April). Danny Menendez/ BuzzFeed News Inside among SmileDirectClub's New York City places. SmileDirectClub's organisation model seems working. Align Innovation the business that makes Invisalign, SmileDirect's primary rival invested $46.7 million to become SmileDirect's unique supplier in 2015, and this year invested another $12.8 million, to own an overall of 19% of the company. Meanwhile, lookalikes have introduced with comparable services: Orthly, introduced by two University of Pennsylvania trainees, now provides services to consumers in Philadelphia, and Honest Co. introduced in New York this summer season. A SmileDirect customer can be matched with among 225 affiliated dental professionals or orthodontists in all 50 states. These oral experts from another location examine client cases and then create the aligners that SmileDirect sends out in the mail. The business decreased to call any of the physician within its network, and would not supply details about its financial relationships with them. ""Essentially they are collecting payments and paying us marketing costs,"" Fenkell said.""I think that claim is rather phony,"" AAO's basic counsel Dillard stated. ""The consumers don't even see a dental professional. (SmileDirectClub has a two star rating on Yelp.) And many expert dental experts are alarmed that clients never ever see a licensed physician prior to or throughout their treatment.""It blew my mind,"" Casi Stubbs, a Florida orthodontist and member of the American Association of Orthodontists, informed BuzzFeed News. Like typical orthodontists, SmileDirect's dental professionals base their prescriptions on computer simulations of mouth scans. ""The teeth don't move biologically like they do on the computer system,"" Stubbs said. Among her patients, 60 year old Charlene Burnham, is a SmileDirect client whose too tight aligners cut her gums, exposing part of her tooth near the root. Burnham told BuzzFeed News she invested a week attempting and failing to talk with a SmileDirect dental professional on the phone, then went to Stubbs for help.""They were bleeding, they were cut to the root,"" Burnham stated. ""I was horrified.""A SmileDirect representative told BuzzFeed News by e mail that company affiliated dentists ""track the client's development throughout treatment at routine periods.""The company ""assists in the interactions"" of customers and oral providers, the representative said. ""Oral suppliers interact directly with patients through the consumer portal and via SMS or phone when suitable or indicated.""In a YouTube video that's been seen over 21,000 times given that June, Baltimore orthodontist Jeffrey Miller alerted individuals far from the service, stating that no orthodontist would ever prescribe aligners without first taking the X rays that SmileDirect avoids. (The video was removed after this story released.)Grant Olson, a dentist in Springfield, Missouri, informed BuzzFeed News that the company's item marketing, which compares itself with orthodontist fitted Invisalign, is misguiding. Unlike Invisalign trays, which orthodontists can enhance by sticking special accessories on a tooth, SmileDirect's product is restricted to extremely minor corrections: The aligners can correct a tilt, but can't move a tooth's orientation or position in addition to its root. He described that SmileDirect affiliated orthodontists just authorize cases that are suitable for a remote assessment and do not need follow up dental check outs (Smile Direct Club Deals Buy One Get One Free April). Laws for dental professionals differ across states, but there are some common themes in the 36 grievances sent by the AAO: Some states consider making impressions and supplying retainers to be the role of a licensed medical professional, but SmileDirectClub normally offers those services. AAO general counsel Dillard also told BuzzFeed News that the business's service model incentivizes dental practitioners associated with SmileDirect to recommend the trays even if they aren't required. Danny Menendez/ BuzzFeed News Although the company hasn't attracted the attention of regulators yet, consumer problems are plentiful online. TL; DR: Get ready for a rough flight. The large bulk of customers in these groups resign themselves to handling the snags because there are simply no other alternatives (Smile Direct Club Deals Buy One Get One Free April).""If you can be client, want an inexpensive plan, SDC IS the ideal method to go! Having a favorable attitude and being patient goes a LONG way,"" Melanie Masso composed to BuzzFeed News. For numerous other consumers, the flight is a bust. Seattle resident Melissa Gulick informed BuzzFeed News that at the end of almost a year of treatment, the aligners have actually ruined her bite: Her front teeth touch prior to her molars can make contact (Smile Direct Club Deals Buy One Get One Free April). ""I'm quite frustrated food is difficult to chew now and they will not fix it!""Gulick said that after complaints to the company, SmileDirectClub accepted continue treatment totally free. When asked about problems that the trays destroyed clients' bites, a SmileDirect representative told BuzzFeed News: ""Over 95% of our consumers complete treatment and sign off on their finished new smile. It's essential to bear in mind that with any orthodontic procedure, bites will continue to shift up until the treatment is finished.""Another consumer, 24 year old Drexel University student Kacie Durham, informed BuzzFeed News that SmileDirectClub sent her a simulated treatment plan that made her teeth look worse.""It actually made my teeth appear more crooked at the bottom,"" she stated. Durham returned her trays and looked for a refund. Later, an orthodontist not connected with the company told her that her teeth would have to be filed and shaped before they might be lined up. Durham felt fooled: SmileDirect had authorized her for a treatment that would never have worked.""If a possible consumer is unhappy with the 3d preview of his/her smile, there is no responsibility to buy aligners,"" the SmileDirectClub representative stated (Smile Direct Club Deals Buy One Get One Free April). Minelle Tendler, a Boca Raton orthodontist, joined one of the greatest Facebook groups, the 11,800 member SmileDirectClub Assistance, after 2 of her patients inquired about the product. In perusing the posts that appear in her Facebook feed, Tendler said that she's not seen anybody say they have actually been able to talk with a dental professional at the company. ""You're asking somebody who has no dental background, 'Is this going to work?'""More than as soon as, Tendler has stopped short of responding to threads on the forum. She rests on her hands since the clients are not hers. ""I'm taking a look at the images and thinking, Oh my god, you need to get teeth taken out, don't do it.""Mostly, she is stressed that individuals who are charmed by SmileDirectClub's low rate aren't completely mindful of the disadvantages of avoiding a dental go to. A previous variation of this post misidentified him as an orthodontist. Align Innovation owns 19% of SmileDirectClub. A previous variation of this story mentioned it was 17%. Likewise, SmileDirectClub started running in North Carolina in early October. A previous variation of this story, based upon an August interview with cofounder Alex Fenkell, stated that the company was not operating in North Carolina. Mail in aligners might seem like an excellent option for a minor fix. However keep in mind you're not the specialist on how minimal a fix your teeth require. ""It's challenging to go from something that's 90% excellent to make it 100% best; in my experience, I discover that these are the harder cases,"" Dr. The outcomes of using unnoticeable aligners can be very unforeseeable, because some individuals react well to them and others will not. ""It's extremely hard to monitor this by yourself, because like everything in medicine not everyone reacts the very same,"" he states. The genuine problem comes with figuring out how to fix your smile if you're not reacting correctly to the retainers, he says. smiledirectreview Copyright © 2021 Beautiful Teeth: Smile Direct | Sitemap | Privacy Policy | Terms and Conditions | Disclaimer policy | Cookie policy | Contact Us","Mattress Encyclopedia Smile Direct Club Black Triangles After Treatment smiledirectclubreview / By MattressTeacher In June, the thin, transparent plastic trays that fit over her top and bottom teeth can be found in the mail.

We will highlight those with the most potential impact to membership, but everyone is encouraged to read through the list of bills in your respective state(s) to make sure you have the latest information available. April was a month for movement and enactment on good and bad bills around the country. We will highlight those with the most potential impact to membership, but everyone is encouraged to read through the list of bills in your respective state(s) to make sure you have the latest information available. Apprentice/Labor Colorado SB 19 196 adds several required evaluation factors including the craft labor staffing plan for the project bidder and subcontractors, the anticipated utilization by the bidder and its subcontractors of apprentices registered with federal or state apprenticeship agencies to complete the work under the contract, and the safety plan and safety record of the bidder and the bidder's subcontractors. It will require bidders for contracts over $1 million to demonstrate use of approved apprenticeship programs for labor used to complete the project. This bill passed the Senate on April 16th and was sent to the House, where it was assigned to the State, Veterans, & Military Affairs Committee. It passed the House with amendments on April 29th and on April 30, 2019 the Senate considered the House amendments, concurred, and voted to repass. Illinois SB 1474 is touted as a ""collective bargaining freedom"" bill, but in reality, creates a framework that would require membership in labor unions where collective bargaining agreements are reached. This bill was enacted on April 12, 2019. Maine LD 1564 (SP 499) provides for the ability of a public works project to include a project labor agreement, but conditions on the agreement would prohibit any provision that requires increased costs, construction delays, or forced participation in a labor union as a condition of the agreement. Nevada SB 207, which requires contractors and subcontractors to comply with apprenticeship requirements was passed in the Senate on April 19th and is now headed to the House. The bill was amended to increase the percentage of time required for approved apprentices on public works projects. Arkansas SB 564 and Arizona HB 2569 are two of several bills around the country that provide for expedited licensing for veterans, returning veterans and their spouses who are licensed in another state. Both bills were enacted on April 10, 2019. Idaho HB 248 provides for training and experience equivalency for the purposes of occupational licensing of applicants with honorable military experience. It also provides for expedited licensing requirements. This bill was enacted into law on April 3, 2019. The Tennessee bills (SB 1443 and HB 602) that would prohibit local governments from using alarm companies as collection agents to collect their annual alarm registration fees and from fining alarm companies for false alarms continued to move in April. SB 1443 passed the Senate and House and was forwarded to the Governor on April 30, 2019 where it awaits his signature. A bill in Colorado is cause for some concern and confusion. SB 19 156 is the sunset bill for the State Electrical Board. The bill itself makes no mention of anything other than extending the powers and duties of the board for 13 years, adding at least one residential electrician to the board and several other changes that do not impact our industry. However, the fiscal note summary provides bullet points on what this bill does, including one bullet point that claims the bill, ""clarifies that communications systems, data systems, and security systems are subject to regulation if they are part of a building's electrical system . . ."" We have not identified the source of this language, but we do know that security systems are not included in the most recently published version of the bill. This bill passed the House on April 30, 2019 and the Senate concurred with the amendments passed by the House on May 1st. ND HB 1157, which was dramatically altered after it passed the House, passed the Senate and after a conference committee was convened passed the House with amendments. The enrolled version was sent to the Governor on April 24th. This bill will create a ""power limited electrician"" license, but exempts persons installing what is referred to in the bill as ""nonelectrical systems"". The definition of a nonelectrical system is defined as ""a system as defined by the articles contained in chapter 8 and other articles which contains class II or class III circuits and systems as defined by the national electrical code, as adopted by the board. Although the board may expand this definition, the board may not narrow this definition. The term does not include a circuit or system that is installed: a. Within an area of special occupancies, as defined under articles 500 through 517 of the national electrical code. b. For heat, light, or power. c. For the control of heat, light, or power, unless the circuit or system employs digital communication."" There remains some confusion on how this new law will be interpreted, particularly the term ""digital communication."" We will have to see how this new legislation will also be viewed in light of SB 2359, which mandates the study of power limited systems.

The order of months in the Roman calendar has been January to December since King Numa Pompilius in about 700 BC, according to Plutarch and Macrobius. However, Roman writers identified years by naming the year's consuls, who did not enter office on 1 January until 153 BC. Since then 1 January has been the first day of the year, except during the Middle Ages when several other days were the first (1 March, 25 March, Easter, 1 September, 25 December). With the expansion of Western culture to the rest of the world during the twentieth century, the 1 January date became global, even in countries with their own New Year celebrations on other days (e.g., China and India). At present, the celebration of the New Year is a major event worldwide. Many large scale events are held in major cities around the world, with many large fireworks events on New Year's Eve (31 December). Sydney launched over 80,000 fireworks at midnight, and had more than one and a half million attendees; it was also the most watched event on television worldwide last year. In Valparaiso upwards of two million visitors witnessed the largest fireworks display in a natural setting; a total of more than 21 kilometers of fireworks on the bay, from the commercial port city of Valparaiso to Concon, Chile, all in 25 minutes of entertainment. London's New Year celebrations centre around the London Eye, with an impressive fireworks display while Big Ben strikes midnight. In New York, the celebration is focused around a large crystal ball that descends in a one minute countdown in Times Square. Edinburgh plays host to one of the world's largest Hogmanay events. The celebrations last for four days and attract visitors from around the globe to take part in street parties and attend concerts. In the culture of Latin America there are a variety of traditions and superstitions surrounding these dates as omens for the coming year. January remains a symbol of the New Year's celebration. According to the Christian tradition, 1 January coincides with the circumcision of Christ (eight days after birth), when the name of Jesus was given to him (Luke 2: 21). 7 January Orthodox Christmas Christmas or Christmas Day is an annual Christian holiday commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ. It is celebrated on December 25, but this date is not known to be Jesus' actual birthday, and may have initially been chosen to correspond with either the day exactly nine months after some early Christians believed Jesus had been conceived, a historical Roman festival, or the date of the northern hemisphere's winter solstice. Christmas is central to the Christmas and holiday season, and in Christianity marks the beginning of the larger season of Christmastide, which lasts twelve days 8 January Orthodox second day of Christmas (Božić/Божић) 17 April Orthodox Good Friday (Veliki petak) Good Friday, also called Holy Friday, Black Friday, or Great Friday, is a holiday observed primarily by adherents to Christianity commemorating the crucifixion of Jesus and his death at Calvary. The holiday is observed during Holy Week as part of the Paschal Triduum on the Friday preceding Easter Sunday, and often coincides with the Jewish observance of Passover. Based on the scriptural details of the Sanhedrin Trial of Jesus, the Crucifixion of Jesus was most probably on a Friday. The estimated year of Good Friday is AD 33, by two different groups, and originally as AD 34 by Isaac Newton via the differences between the Biblical and Julian calendars and the crescent of the moon. A third method, using a completely different astronomical approach based on a lunar Crucifixion darkness and eclipse model (consistent with Apostle Peter's reference to a ""moon of blood"" in Acts 2:20) arrives at the same date, namely Friday April 3, AD 33. 20 April Orthodox Easter Monday Easter (Greek: Πάσχα) is the most important annual religious feast in the Christian liturgical year. According to Christian scripture, Jesus was resurrected from the dead on the third day of his crucifixion. Christians celebrate this resurrection on Easter Day or Easter Sunday (also Resurrection Day or Resurrection Sunday), two days after Good Friday and three days after Maundy Thursday. The chronology of his death and resurrection is variously interpreted to be between AD 26 and AD 36. Easter also refers to the season of the church year called Eastertide or the Easter Season. Traditionally the Easter Season lasted for the forty days from Easter Day until Ascension Day but now officially lasts for the fifty days until Pentecost. The first week of the Easter Season is known as Easter Week or the Octave of Easter. Easter also marks the end of Lent, a season of fasting, prayer, and penance. Easter is a moveable feast, meaning it is not fixed in relation to the civil calendar. The First Council of Nicaea (325) established the date of Easter as the first Sunday after the full moon (the Paschal Full Moon) following the vernal equinox. Ecclesiastically, the equinox is reckoned to be on March 21. The date of Easter therefore varies between March 22 and April 25. Eastern Christianity bases its calculations on the Julian Calendar whose March 21 corresponds, during the twenty first century, to April 3 in the Gregorian Calendar, in which calendar their celebration of Easter therefore varies between April 4 and May 8. Easter is linked to the Jewish Passover not only for much of its symbolism but also for its position in the calendar. Relatively newer elements such as the Easter Bunny and Easter egg hunts have become part of the holiday's modern celebrations, and those aspects are often celebrated by many Christians and non Christians alike. 20 April Orthodox Easter Monday (Veliki ponedjeljak/Велики понедјељак) 27 April Constitution Day 1 May Labour Day (Dan rada) International Workers' Day (a name used interchangeably with may day) is a celebration of the social and economic achievements of the international labor movement. May Day commonly sees organized street demonstrations and street marches by millions of working people and their labour unions throughout most of the countries of the world. 2 May Labour Day (Dan rada/Дан рада) 9 May Victory Day 21 May Independence Day (Dan nezavisnosti/Дан независности) 29 November Republic Day Algeria | Angola | Botswana | Eritrea | Ghana | Malawi | Mali | Brazil | Dominica | Saint Kitts and Nevis | French Polynesia | Guam | Samoa | Belgium | Denmark | Greece | Spain | Liechtenstein | Lithuania | Monaco | Romania | Azerbaijan | Yemen | Jordan | Oman | Pakistan | Tanzania | Côte d'Ivoire | Zimbabwe | United States Црна Гора, Crna Gora Official languages: Montenegrin (national) Government: Republic Currency: Euro (EUR) Area: 13812 km² Religion: Orthodox Church Time Zone: UTC +1 Auto Code: MNE Internet TLD: .me Calling code: +382 Corporate Income Tax: 9,00% Personal Income Tax: 15,00% Value Added Tax: 17,00% more (wkipedia) (wikipedia)","Public Holidays: Georgia En Française 在中國 Today: Tuesday 19 January 2021 Today Holidays Ethiopia: Epiphany Eritrea: Coptic Epiphany Georgia: Baptism Day of our Lord Jesus Christ 1419 Hundred Years' War: Rouen surrenders to Henry V of England completing his reconquest of Normandy. 1511 Mirandola surrenders to the French. 1520 Sten Sture the Younger, the Regent of Sweden, is mortally wounded at the Battle of Bogesund. 1607 San Agustin Church in Manila is officially completed; it is currently the oldest church in the Philippines 1764 John Wilkes is expelled from the British House of Commons for seditious libel. 1788 Second group of ships of the First Fleet arrives at Botany Bay. 1795 Batavian Republic is proclaimed in the Netherlands.

Christmas is central to the Christmas and holiday season, and in Christianity marks the beginning of the larger season of Christmastide, which lasts twelve days 19 January Baptism Day of our Lord Jesus Christ (ნათლისღება, Nathlisgheba) Usually called the Feast of Theophany (Greek: Θεοφάνεια, ""God shining forth"" or ""divine manifestation""), it is one of the Great Feasts of the liturgical year, being third in rank, behind only Pascha (Easter) and Pentecost in importance. It is celebrated on January 6 of the calendar that the particular Church uses. On the Julian Calendar, which some of the Orthodox churches follow, that date corresponds, during the present century, to January 19 on the Gregorian or Revised Julian calendar. Today in Eastern Orthodox churches, the emphasis at this feast is on the shining forth and revelation of Jesus Christ as the Messiah and Second Person of the Trinity at the time of his baptism. It is also celebrated because, according to tradition, the baptism of Jesus in the Jordan River by St. John the Baptist marked one of only two occasions when all three Persons of the Trinity manifested themselves simultaneously to humanity: God the Father by speaking through the clouds, God the Son being baptized in the river, and God the Holy Spirit in the shape of a dove descending from heaven (the other occasion was the Transfiguration on Mount Tabor). Thus the holy day is considered to be a Trinitarian feast. 3 March Mother's Day (დედის დღე, Dedis dghe) 8 March International Women's Day (ქალთა საერთაშორისო დღე, Kalta saertachoriso dghe) International Women's Day (IWD) is marked on March 8 every year. It is a major day of global celebration for the economic, political and social achievements of women. Started as a political event, the holiday blended in the culture of many countries (primarily Russia and the countries of former Soviet bloc). In some celebrations, the day lost its political flavour, and became simply an occasion for men to express their love to the women around them in a way somewhat similar to Mother's Day and St Valentine's Day mixed together. In others, however, the political and human rights theme as designated by the United Nations runs strong, and political and social awareness of the struggles of women worldwide are brought out and examined in a hopeful manner. 9 April Day of National Unity (ეროვნული ერთიანობის დღე, Erovnouli ertianobis dghe) Commemoration of the April 9 tragedy 1989(also known as Tbilisi Massacre, Tbilisi tragedy) when on Rustaveli Avenue, in Tbilisi an anti Soviet demonstration was dispersed by the Soviet Army, resulting in 20 deaths and hundreds of injuries. 3 May Orthodox Easter Monday (აღდგომა, Aghdgoma) Easter (Greek: Πάσχα) is the most important annual religious feast in the Christian liturgical year. According to Christian scripture, Jesus was resurrected from the dead on the third day of his crucifixion. Christians celebrate this resurrection on Easter Day or Easter Sunday (also Resurrection Day or Resurrection Sunday), two days after Good Friday and three days after Maundy Thursday. The chronology of his death and resurrection is variously interpreted to be between AD 26 and AD 36. Easter also refers to the season of the church year called Eastertide or the Easter Season. Traditionally the Easter Season lasted for the forty days from Easter Day until Ascension Day but now officially lasts for the fifty days until Pentecost. The first week of the Easter Season is known as Easter Week or the Octave of Easter. Easter also marks the end of Lent, a season of fasting, prayer, and penance. Easter is a moveable feast, meaning it is not fixed in relation to the civil calendar. The First Council of Nicaea (325) established the date of Easter as the first Sunday after the full moon (the Paschal Full Moon) following the vernal equinox. Ecclesiastically, the equinox is reckoned to be on March 21. The date of Easter therefore varies between March 22 and April 25. Eastern Christianity bases its calculations on the Julian Calendar whose March 21 corresponds, during the twenty first century, to April 3 in the Gregorian Calendar, in which calendar their celebration of Easter therefore varies between April 4 and May 8. Easter is linked to the Jewish Passover not only for much of its symbolism but also for its position in the calendar. Relatively newer elements such as the Easter Bunny and Easter egg hunts have become part of the holiday's modern celebrations, and those aspects are often celebrated by many Christians and non Christians alike. 9 May Victory Day (ფაშიზმზე გამარჯვების დღე, Phachizmze gamardjvebis dghe) 12 May Saint Andrea the First Day (წმინდა მოციქულის ანდრია პირველწოდებულის საქართველოში შემოსვლის დღე, Ts'minda motsiqhoulis andreys pirvelts'odeboulis sakartvelochi chemosvla dghe) Celebration of day of Apostle Andrew the 'first called', founder of Georgian Orthodox Church. 26 May Independence Day (დამოუკიდებლობის დღე, Damouk'ideblobis dghe) On May 26, 1918 National Council of Georgia declared national independence of Georgian people and creation of Democratic Republic of Georgia. The statehood of Georgia was restored after 117 years (from 1801) 28 August Assumption of Mary (მარიამობა, Mariamoba) According to the belief of Christians of the Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox, and Oriental Orthodox churches and by some Anglicans, the Assumption of Mary was the bodily taking up of the Virgin Mary into Heaven at the end of her life. The Catholic Church teaches as dogma that Mary, ""having completed the course of her earthly life, was assumed body and soul into heavenly glory."" This doctrine was dogmatically and infallibly defined by Pope Pius XII on November 1, 1950, in his Apostolic Constitution Munificentissimus Deus. This belief is known as the Dormition by the Orthodox. In the churches which observe it, the Assumption is a major festival, commonly celebrated on August 15. In many countries it is a Catholic Holy Day of Obligation. In his August 15, 2004, homily given at Lourdes, Pope John Paul II quoted John 14:3 as one of the scriptural bases for understanding the dogma of the Assumption of Mary. In this verse, Jesus tells his disciples at the Last Supper, ""If I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and will receive you to myself; that where I am, you may be there also."" According to Catholic theology, Mary is the pledge of the fulfillment of Christ's promise. 14 October Day of Svetitskhoveli Cathedral (in Mtskheta) (სვეტიცხოვლობა, Svetistskhovloba) Celebration of the cathedral in the centre of Mtskheta one of the sacred places of Georgia, it was erected in the 11th c by the architect Arsukidze in the place where the first Christian church in Georgia stood in the 4th c.

(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite, File) WASHINGTON (AP) — Arizona asked the Supreme Court Tuesday to allow enforcement of a ban on abortions performed solely because of Down syndrome and other genetic abnormalities. The request from the state's Republican attorney general, Mark Brnovich, comes as the high court is weighing rolling back abortion rights nationwide and in the immediate aftermath of a decision keeping in place Texas' ban on abortion after about six weeks, while allowing some challenges to the law to continue. A federal judge blocked the provision of Arizona law enacted earlier this year that would have let prosecutors bring felony charges against a doctor who knowingly terminates a pregnancy solely because of a genetic abnormality. A federal appeals court also refused to allow its enforcement. Several Republican led states have enacted laws prohibiting abortion based on a fetal diagnosis of Down syndrome or other genetic issues, among hundreds of new abortion restrictions put in place in recent years. The federal appeals court in Cincinnati allowed Ohio's law to take effect and appellate judges in St. Louis are deliberating over a similar law in Missouri. When the issue last came to the Supreme Court, in 2019, the justices rejected Indiana's appeal over enforcing its law, which also prohibited abortion because of the race or sex of the fetus. Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a lengthy opinion in which he said the Indiana law ""and other laws like it promote a State's compelling interest in preventing abortion from becoming a tool of modern day eugenics."" Arizona also prohibits abortions over race and sex, but those provisions are not at issue. Brnovich argued in court papers that the law furthers Arizona's interest in protecting the disability community from discrimination. He also wrote that it's not right to call the law an abortion ban. A woman still could obtain an abortion in such circumstances if she doesn't say why she wants one or makes a decision independent of a fetal abnormality, among other reasons, he wrote. The case goes first to Justice Elena Kagan, who handles emergency requests from Arizona. Looking into the future?

The ancient world braces itself for war on an unprecedented scale. Prince Hattu, the greatest of the Hittite generals, suffers dreams of terrible consequences conjured by the Goddess Ishtar. But Hattu refuses to accept her prophecies, adamant that there is one last chance for peace. This fragile hope lies in the borderlands of the east, where the two rival empires touch.

We realize that there are many different interpretations of the standard grades used for pre owned vinyl record albums & CD, so we thought we'd offer you the ones that we are working with, so you have an idea what we mean when we give the grade for a non new item on our pages. Used Vinyl Grades Below are stated conditions for a used vinyl records at Dusty Groove. Grading for the cover should be assumed to be near (within a ""+"" or "" "") the grading for the vinyl. If there is significant divergence from the condition of the vinyl, or specific flaws, these will be noted in the comments section of the item. However, please be aware that since the emphasis of this site is towards the music listener, our main concern is with the vinyl of any used item we sell. Additionally, all of our records are graded visually; considering the volume of used vinyl we handle, it is impossible for us to listen to each record. If we spot any significant flaws, we make every attempt to listen through them and note how they play. The following grading conditions apply to the vinyl component of an album or single: This is what it says, that the record is still held fast in shrink wrap. We tend to be pretty suspicious about these things, so if the shrink wrap doesn't look original, or if the record seems to have undergone some damage over time, we'll probably take it out of the wrapper to ensure that it's in good shape — which is why we don't have more of these. In some cases the shrink wrap may be torn in spots, but if it's not possible the record has been taken out and played, the record will still qualify as ""Sealed"". Dusty Groove does not use the grades of Near Mint (or Mint, for that matter) because in our experience, we find that no records ever qualify for such a high grade. Even sealed records tend to have one or two slight faults, enough to usually qualify them for a grade of NM or lower. We've often found that records which are clearly unplayed will have a slight amount of surface noise, especially in quieter recordings. Near Mint (minus) Black vinyl that may show a slight amount of dust or dirt. Should still be very shiny under a light, even with slight amount of dust on surface. One or two small marks that would make an otherwise near perfect record slightly less so. These marks cannot be too deep, and should only be surface marks that won't affect play, but might detract from the looks. May have some flaws and discoloration in the vinyl, but only those that would be intrinsic to the pressing. These should disappear when the record is tilted under the light, and will only show up when looking straight at the record. (Buddah and ABC pressings from the 70's are a good example of this.) May have some slight marks from aging of the paper sleeve on the vinyl. Possible minor surface noise when played. Very Good + (plus) Vinyl should be very clean, but can have less luster than near mint. Should still shine under a light, but one or two marks may show up when tilted. Can have a few small marks that may show up easily, but which do not affect play at all. Most marks of this quality will disappear when the record is tilted, and will not be felt with the back of a fingernail. This is the kind of record that will play ""near mint"", but which will have some signs of use (although not major ones). May have slight surface noise when played. Vinyl can have some dirt, but nothing major. May not shine under light, but should still be pretty clean, and not too dirty. May have a number of marks (5 to 10 at most), and obvious signs of play, but never a big cluster of them, or any major mark that would be very deep. Most marks should still not click under a fingernail. May not look near perfect, but should play fairly well, with slight surface noise, and the occasional click in part of a song, but never throughout a whole song or more. This is clearly a copy that was played by someone a number of times, but which could also be a good ""play copy"" for someone new. Very Good (minus) Vinyl may be dirty, and can lack a fair amount of luster. Vinyl can have a number of marks, either in clusters or smaller amounts, but deeper. This is the kind of record that you'd buy to play, but not because it looked that great. Still, the flaws should be mostly cosmetic, with nothing too deep that would ruin the overall record. Examples include a record that has been kept for a while in a cover without the paper sleeve, or heavily played by a previous owner and has some marks across the surface. The record should play okay, though probably with surface noise. Good + (plus) Vinyl may be dirty, or have one outstanding flaw, such as a light residue, which could be difficult to clean. May have marks on all parts, too many to qualify as Very Good , or several deeper marks, but the record should still be ok for play without skips. In general, this is a record that was played a fair amount, and handled without care. A typical example may be a record which has been heavily played by a DJ, and carries marks from slip cueing. Depending on the quality of the vinyl, may play with surface noise throughout. A record that you'd buy to play, cheap, but which you wouldn't buy for collecting. Will have marks across all parts of the playing surface, and will most likely play with surface noise throughout. May have some other significant flaws, such as residue, or a track that skips. In most cases, a poor quality copy of a very difficult to find record. This is a grade we rarely use, as we try not to sell records in very bad condition, though in some rare cases we will list a record in such bad shape that it does not conform to the standards above. A ""Fair"" record will have enough marks or significant flaws that it does not even qualify as ""Good"", but is a copy you might consider for playing, if you're willing to put up with noise and/or flaws. An example might be a recording with surface noise so heavy that it is equal to the volume of the music. For records listed as ""Fair"", we will describe the extent of the condition in the comments. Like ""Fair"", we rarely list records in this condition, as they represent the extreme low end of spectrum. These records typically have multiple serious problems, and we offer them as ""relics"" or ""objects"" only — for those who want to at least have a copy of a record, even if it is not really worthy of play, perhaps for the cover alone. For these records, we will describe the extent of the condition in the comments. Additional Marks & Notes If something is noteworthy, we try to note it in the comments — especially if it is an oddity that is the only wrong thing about the record. This might include, but isn't limited to, warped records, tracks that skip, cover damage or wear as noted above, or strictly cosmetic flaws. Used CD Grade We have only one grade for non new CDs at Dusty Groove — ""Used CD"". This grade is somewhat all encompassing, but we choose it because we try to offer Used CDs in the best shape possible. When you purchase a Used CD you can expect the disc to be free of all but the lightest of surface marks, the case to be clean (we often change the cases ourselves), and the booklet to be in good shape. Used CDs may show some signs of use but if there are significant details or defects we will list them underneath the item — just like we do with LPs — so look there for notes on cutout marks, stickers, promo stamps or other details. All of our Used CDs are guaranteed to play without skipping or flaws. If you purchase a Used CD from Dusty Groove, you have 1 week to play it to determine that it plays correctly — and if it does not, then you may return it for a full refund.

Will have marks across all parts of the playing surface, and will most likely play with surface noise throughout. May have some other significant flaws, such as residue, or a track that skips. In most cases, a poor quality copy of a very difficult to find record. This is a grade we rarely use, as we try not to sell records in very bad condition, though in some rare cases we will list a record in such bad shape that it does not conform to the standards above. A ""Fair"" record will have enough marks or significant flaws that it does not even qualify as ""Good"", but is a copy you might consider for playing, if you're willing to put up with noise and/or flaws. An example might be a recording with surface noise so heavy that it is equal to the volume of the music. For records listed as ""Fair"", we will describe the extent of the condition in the comments. Like ""Fair"", we rarely list records in this condition, as they represent the extreme low end of spectrum. These records typically have multiple serious problems, and we offer them as ""relics"" or ""objects"" only — for those who want to at least have a copy of a record, even if it is not really worthy of play, perhaps for the cover alone. For these records, we will describe the extent of the condition in the comments. Additional Marks & Notes If something is noteworthy, we try to note it in the comments — especially if it is an oddity that is the only wrong thing about the record. This might include, but isn't limited to, warped records, tracks that skip, cover damage or wear as noted above, or strictly cosmetic flaws. Used CD Grade We have only one grade for non new CDs at Dusty Groove — ""Used CD"". This grade is somewhat all encompassing, but we choose it because we try to offer Used CDs in the best shape possible. All of our Used CDs are guaranteed to play without skipping or flaws. If you purchase a Used CD from Dusty Groove, you have 1 week to play it to determine that it plays correctly — and if it does not, then you may return it for a full refund. With our Used CDs, you can expect the disc to be free of all but the lightest of surface marks — clean, and not dirty at all. You can also expect the case to be clean (we often change the cases ourselves — putting fresh cases on Used CDs we handle) — and you can expect the booklet to be in good shape, unless noted otherwise. We will list any specific details/defects underneath the item — so look for notes on cutout marks in the case, stamps on the barcode, or details like that.

Evidently, this is amongst the beaches in Phuket in which the waves can get to be big according to the reviews. People also mention jet skis, and whatever beach you visit, you certainly want to investigate the activities available. Nai Harn Beach is another recommended beach stop when you're in Phuket. It's actually considered to be the ideal beach in Phuket as well as the top attraction or 'thing to do' also. You could expect the identical type of beach in many ways, where there are vendors there. Lifeguards are saved to duty in accordance with the reviews, and swimming and the entire body surfing is fairly popular there. Straight back to the animals! Specifically dogs are the main topic of the next attraction in Phuket. It's the Soi Dog Foundation, which is a rescue center that features cats. Isn't it cool how a pair of the most notable attractions cope with rescuing animals? It's really neat that they have made it an area that folks would like to visit, and also the reviews discuss the event being heartwarming. The Big Buddha was mentioned earlier, but the attraction hasn't been formally introduced. It's the Phuket Big Buddha, in fact it is quite large indeed. The monument consists of white marble. I for starters don't like visiting other attractions that deal with religion, but you can find others who wish to begin to see the attraction, which is rather new anyway. No matter what for you to do while vacationing in Phuket, there exists plenty to find out. You will discover a nightlife there, and you will imagine there are going to be some really awesome restaurants serving up local cuisine and much more. In addition there are spas there. Is it possible to imagine getting the knowledge of per day spa in Thailand? It will be quite not the same as the types of health spa services available from one in your own home. Another beach that is certainly popular to visit is Freedom Beach. Other attractions include Surf House, which appears like fun for your kids, Naka Market, Monkey Hill and Tiger Kingdom. Their list continues, and also you are invited to spend some time vacationing in Phuket, Thailand.

You might think the founder of that company, Zeus Tipado, is a stoner and you'd be right. But he's also an entrepreneur. ""We have established ourselves as the premiere platform for cannabis and competitive gameplay,"" Tipado said. The company first launched in 2014 when recreational marijuana use wasn't legal in the state of California. However, thanks to new regulations regarding marijuana use, Tipado has more freedom to expand his gaming league. ""[We brought] organization to this entire community, which quite frankly has been there for a long time,"" he explained. ""Once this exists, then something else is going to exist and once it is inside, firmly inside, then it's just going to open up."" In the SGL, players are required to provide proof of elevation — meaning you have to get high in order to compete. Big partners like the streaming platform, Twitch, have already signed on and now Tipado is developing an arena space in East Los Angeles. The arena is set to open in February, 2019.

It has floor cushions to use defensive spells and Dark Detectors. The Chamber is also the home of an immortal memory of Tom Riddle, who was killed by Harry Potter. The Chamber of Secrets is also the home of two serpents in the solid wall of the Room. They have the eyes of emerald. They are believed to have been summoned by Tom Riddle. They are also able to grow the Devil's Snare, a large snake that attacks anyone who is in the Chamber. The Chamber also has a snake scratching faucet. Fang, a giant boarhound in black is a resident of the Chamber. Fang is more friendly than Mrs. Norris. The dungeon is home to the Slytherin dormitory. The room is decorated with carved armchairs and is green. It also houses the statue of Salazar Slytherin. The room is decorated with green lamps and a greenish glow. The Hufflepuff dormitory has low ceilings and is a comfortable, sunny space. The plants hang from the ceiling. It also has a huge common room. The badger is the house animal. The badger is believed to symbolize the family gathering. Nearly Headless Nick is also a ghost that haunts the house. There are a few shortcuts that can be utilized to get from the school to the castle. These aren't always easy, however. They are usually hidden behind tapestry or by an entry that is hidden. Some of these short cuts are only available to members of the House. The secret entrance for Hufflepuff is behind barrels. It is also under spell, so tap the barrel in rhythm to open a slimy chute. The Dark Room is the place where Dumbledore's Army gathers. It is also where the battles are fought during the Harry Potter series. It is also where Dumbledore debates in Harry's defence. It also has floor cushions for defensive spells as well as volumes of Defence Against the Dark Arts. There are also secret entrances to four House dormitories. These are also hidden from the outside and require a password or ritual. These entrances are used by members of that House. The Hogwarts Escape Houses Of Hogwarts Traits",0.96980023

Photo: Christophe Archambault/AFP A French court on Thursday handed former president Nicolas Sarkozy a one year sentence for illegal financing of his 2012 re election bid, dealing a fresh blow to the right winger six months after a conviction for corruption. Sarkozy will not serve time behind bars under the terms of this verdict, however, with the court ruling that he would be able to serve the sentence outside of prison. He was not in court to hear the judge hand down the maximum sentence for illegal campaign financing after finding that he had ""voluntarily neglected"" to monitor his campaign spending. Sarkozy's lawyer Thierry Herzog said he would appeal the verdict. The verdict which means he will likely serve the term at home with an ankle bracelet if confirmed on appeal is not the same as a suspended sentence and goes down in his record as a full prison term. The 66 year old remains a hugely popular and influential figure on the right despite being caught up in multiple investigations since being voted out of the Elysée Palace after a single term in 2012. In March, he became France's first post war president to be handed a custodial sentence when he was given a three year term, two years of which were suspended, for corruption and influence peddling over attempts to secure favours from a judge. Sarkozy promptly appealed his verdict, and under French sentencing guidelines he has not yet been put behind bars judges said he could wear an electronic ankle bracelet. Three months later he was back in the dock over his lavish 2012 re election campaign. Illegal campaign financing carries a maximum sentence of a year in prison and a fine of €3,750 euros. Prosecutors had asked the court to give Sarkozy a one year term, but to suspend six months of the sentence. Thirteen other people, including Sarkozy's former campaign manager, several Bygmalion executives and a handful of former directors of Sarkozy's The Republicans party were also tried in the case. They received jail terms of up to three and a half years in prison, with part of the sentences suspended. Before Sarkozy, the only French leader to be sentenced at trial was his predecessor Jacques Chirac, who received a two year suspended sentence in 2011 for corruption over a fake jobs scandal relating to his time as Paris mayor. Sarkozy attended just one day of his five week trial for questioning, a snub that infuriated prosecutors who accused him of acting ""as if he is not answerable to the law like everyone else."" The prosecution says accountants had warned Sarkozy that he was set to blow past the official €22.5 million spending cap but that he insisted on holding more events to fend off his ultimately victorious Socialist rival Francois Hollande. In the end, his campaign spending came to at least €42.8 million, nearly double the legal limit. Sarkozy told the court that he had been too busy running the country to pay attention to an ""accounting detail"" and that the allegations he was reckless with public money were ""a fairytale"". The case is known as the Bygmalion affair, after the name of the public relations firm hired to orchestrate a blitz of lavish US style election rallies. Bygmalion executives have admitted to using a system of fake invoices to mask the real cost of the events. The investigation failed to prove however that Sarkozy had any direct hand in the fraud. The case failed to garner much interest among the public, with the charges seen as less sensational than the corruption charges that had already dented any prospect of Sarkozy making another comeback. In 2016, he attempted to win back the Elysée Palace but failed to win the presidential nomination for the UMP party, since renamed Les Républicains (LR). Despite his political setbacks and legal woes Sarkozy still enjoys considerable sway in French politics, with conservative candidates in next year's presidential election vying for his endorsement.

Ludovic Marin/Pool via AP/File photo French ex President Nicolas Sarkozy, who was convicted Thursday and sentenced to a year of house arrest for illegal campaign financing of his unsuccessful 2012 reelection bid, will appeal the ruling, his lawyer said. The court said Sarkozy would be allowed to serve the one year sentence at home by wearing an electronic monitoring bracelet. Sarkozy's lawyer, Thierry Herzog, noted that the sentence corresponds to the maximum his client faced. He said he had spoken with Sarkozy, who had asked him to appeal. ""The verdict won't be enforceable"" pending appeal, he added. Sarkozy, France's president from 2007 to 2012, had vigorously denied wrongdoing during the trial in May and June. Sarkozy wasn't present at the Paris court for the ruling. He is accused of having spent almost twice the maximum legal amount of 22.5 million euros ($27.5 million) on the reelection bid that he lost to Socialist Francois Hollande. The court stated that Sarkozy ""knew"" the legal limit was at stake and ""voluntarily"" failed to supervise additional expenses. Thursday's verdict comes after Sarkozy, 66, was found guilty on March 1 of corruption and influence peddling in another case. He was given a year in prison, and two years suspended, in that case but is free pending appeal. It is the first time in France's modern history that a former president has been convicted and sentenced to a prison term for actions during his term. Sarkozy's predecessor, Jacques Chirac, was found guilty in 2011 of misuse of public money during his time as Paris mayor and was given a two year suspended prison sentence. In the campaign financing case, prosecutors concluded that Sarkozy knew weeks before the 2012 election that his expenses — which are strictly limited under French law — were getting close to the legal maximum. They accused him of having ignored two notes from his accountants warning about the money issue. The court on Thursday said despite being aware of the risk of exceeding the limit, he chose to organize many rallies, including giant ones. ""These rallies have been approved by Nicolas Sarkozy and he took advantage of them,"" the court said. During the trial, Sarkozy told the court the extra money didn't go into his campaign, but instead helped make other people richer. He denied any ""fraudulent intent."" He also insisted he didn't handle the day to day organization because he had a team to do that and therefore couldn't be blamed for the amount of spending. In addition to the former president, 13 other people went on trial, including members of his conservative Republicans party, accountants and heads of the communication group in charge of organizing the rallies, Bygmalion. They have all been found guilty, with sentences going from a suspended prison sentence to two years of house arrest with an electronic bracelet. Various charges include forgery, fraud and complicity in illegal campaign financing. Some have acknowledged wrongdoing and detailed the system of false invoices that aimed to cover up the overspending. Sarkozy retired from active politics in 2017, but is still playing a role behind the scenes. French media have reported that he is involved in the process of choosing a conservative candidate ahead of France's presidential election next year.

Last Friday, it was reported that Coincheck had halted client withdrawals without any explanation, giving rise to speculation that the exchange had been hacked. It was later revealed that over $500 million worth of XEM the token for the NEM network had been stolen by hackers, resulting in the biggest crypto theft in history. Now, according to an update from Coincheck, Japan's Financial Services Agency (FSA), has ordered improvements. The exchange is to submit a report to the watchdog by the 13th February on the hack and measures to prevent a recurrence. The watchdog is also considering an on site inspection and is expected to inspect all cryptocurrency exchanges. Since the news of the hack came to light Coincheck has vowed to reimburse customers their lost money; however, Japanese authorities have raised questions as to whether the exchange has enough funds to cover the theft. According to a report from the Financial Times, Coincheck said it would reimburse 260,000 customers, however, it has yet to demonstrate how and when it plans to do this. The FSA claim that the exchange only has balance sheet details for September and that it is seeking more up to date information. ""I hear from the FSA they will put maximum effort into helping Coincheck's customers, including the return of their money,"" said Yoshihide Suga, Japan's chief cabinet secretary. ""I think the FSA will be making sure Coincheck handles this in line with the law and its contractual obligations."" According to a report from the Nikkei, it was due to sloppy management at Coincheck, which left customers' money at risk. As a result, the theft of the cryptocurrency made its loss far greater than that of Mt. Gox. Japan is one of the few countries that has authorised and regulated crypto trading. Since April 2017, it has required digital currency operators to register with the government. However, pre existing exchanges such as Coincheck have been permitted to continue offering services ahead of being officially registered. To date, the financial watchdog has registered 16 crypto exchanges, with another 16 waiting for clearance. Singapore based NEM Foundation said in a recent blog that it had a 'full account of all Coincheck's lost XEM on the blockchain.' It added that the hacker had not moved any of the funds to any exchange or personal accounts, but that it had no way of returning the lost funds to customers. coincheck japan NEM Rebecca Campbell Author| Rcampbell@ethereumworldnews.com Rebecca Campbell is a freelance bitcoin and blockchain journalist based in England. She has a keen interest in the digital currency market and the use cases that the blockchain is being used in and is excited to see the disruptive changes that the technology is delivering in our day to day lives.","Home » Business » Finance Japan to impose wider check after Coincheck hack Source: Agencies | 00:01 UTC+8 January 30, 2018 | Print Edition JAPAN'S financial regulator said yesterday it would inspect all cryptocurrency exchanges and ordered Coincheck to get its act together after hackers stole over US$530 million worth of digital money from its exchange in one of the biggest cyber heists on record. The theft highlights the vulnerabilities in trading an asset that global policymakers are struggling to regulate and the broader risks for Japan as it aims to leverage the fintech industry to stimulate economic growth. The Financial Services Agency yesterday ordered improvements to operations at Tokyo based Coincheck, which on Friday suspended trading in all cryptocurrencies except bitcoin after hackers stole 58 billion yen (US$534 million) of NEM coins, among the most popular digital currencies in the world. Coincheck said on Sunday it would return about 90 percent with internal funds, though it has yet to figure out how or when. The NEM coins were stored in a ""hot wallet"" instead of the more secure ""cold wallet,"" which operates on platforms not directly connected to the Internet, Coincheck said. It also does not use an extra layer of security known as a multi signature system. The hack has drawn into focus Japan's approach to regulating cryptocurrency exchanges. Last year, it became the first country to regulate exchanges at the national level — a move that won praise for boosting innovation and protecting consumers, and that contrasts sharply with crackdowns in South Korea and China. The FSA said it ordered Coincheck to submit a report on the hack and measures for preventing a recurrence by February 13, and that it will, if necessary, conduct on site inspections of other cryptocurrency exchanges. It also said it has yet to confirm whether Coincheck had sufficient funds for the reimbursement. But the FSA does not have any rules banning the use of ""hot wallets"" by exchanges, nor does it set requirements on how much should be kept in ""cold wallets,"" an FSA official said at a briefing. In response to FSA's order for improvements, Coincheck said in a statement that it would promptly strengthen its customer protection and governance, and develop its risk management systems. Japan started to require cryptocurrency exchange operators to register with the government only in April 2017, allowing pre existing operators such as Coincheck to continue offering services ahead of formal registration. The FSA has registered 16 cryptocurrency exchanges so far, and another 16 are still awaiting clearance. Coincheck's application was made in September. ""It's been long said that cryptocurrencies are a solid system but cryptocurrency exchanges are not,"" said Makoto Sakuma, research fellow at NLI Research Institute. ""This incident showed that the problem has not been solved at all. If Coincheck screws up its crisis management, that could deal a blow to the current cryptocurrency fever.""",0.9098056

The studio has announced that Mary Poppins Returns, the sequel to its 1964 classic Mary Poppins, will arrive December 25, 2018. As previously reported, Emily Blunt takes over the role of the practically perfect British nanny, while Hamilton superstar Lin Manuel Miranda stars as a new character named Jack. Along with that release date comes many new details about the story, so keep reading for all the latest on Mary Poppins Returns. Disney announced the Mary Poppins Returns release date via press release today. The film's only direct competition so far for that date is an untitled Warner Bros. event film, though Sony also has its animated Spider Man movie opening a few days earlier on December 21. Here's how Disney describes the story of Mary Poppins Returns: Blunt has been cast as Mary Poppins and Miranda will play a new character, a street lamplighter named Jack. Drawing from the wealth of material in P.L. Travers' seven additional novels, the story will take place in Depression era London (when the books were originally written) and follows a now grown Jane and Michael Banks, who, along with Michael's three children, are visited by the enigmatic Mary Poppins following a personal loss. Through her unique magical skills, and with the aid of her friend Jack, she helps the family rediscover the joy and wonder missing in their lives. Rob Marshall, who directed Blunt in Into the Woods, will return to helm Mary Poppins Returns, from a screenplay by David Magee (Life of Pi, Finding Neverland). Marc Shaiman is composing an all new score, and writing original songs with Scott Wittman. I can't say I've exactly been clamoring for a sequel to Mary Poppins, but only a fool would bet against Disney's live action fairy tale franchise at this point. Sure, Alice Through the Looking Glass was a disappointment, but Maleficent, Cinderella, and The Jungle Book have all been outsized hits. Plus, the involvement of Blunt and Miranda, two of the internet's favorite stars, should help win over some skeptics. The world probably doesn't need a Mary Poppins sequel, but I'll probably be curious enough to check it out anyway when the time comes. Lin Manuel Miranda's 'Tick, Tick… Boom!'

Blunt will play the titular character in the upcoming Mary Poppins Returns; following in the footsteps of veteran actress Julie Andrews who catapulted to fame after winning the Best Actress Awards in the Oscars, BAFTA, and Golden Globes for playing the beloved nanny character. Meanwhile, Miranda, the Pulitzer Prize winner and creator of the hit Broadway musical Hamilton, will be playing a new character named Jack, who, in the sequel, is a streetlamp lighter. The original movie was based on a book by P.L. Travers, about a magical nanny with a flying umbrella who helps improves the lives of the Banks family; particularly brother and sister Michael and Jane. Mary Poppins Returns picks up from where the original left off; set in Depression era London. In the sequel, Mary Poppins meets up with the now grown up Jane Banks, Michael Banks, and his three children after they suffer a personal loss. ""Through her unique magical skills, and with the aid of her friend Jack, she helps the family rediscover the joy and wonder missing in their lives,"" Walt Disney Co. studio told Reuters. It is not clear if original cast members Andrews, now 80 years old, or Dick Van Dyke, the 90 year old actor who played the original sidekick to Mary Poppins, will return in the sequel in any capacity. The new Mary Poppins movie will be directed by Rob Marshall, who worked in another Disney hit, Into the Woods while Finding Neverland writer, David Magee, will work on the screenplay. Award winning musical team Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman will be composing new original songs and scoring for the upcoming sequel.

Former NFL player and head coach Dan Reeves died Saturday at age 77, his family reported. Dan Reeves spent 38 years in the NFL, won a Super Bowl as a player for the Dallas Cowboys, and added another as an assistant to Tom Landry with the same franchise. As head coach, he led the Denver Broncos to three Super Bowls and the Atlanta Falcons to one, although he lost those games. A statement released by his family through former Falcons media relations director Aaron Salkin said Reeves died of complications from dementia. The statement said he died ""in peace and surrounded by his loving family at his home in Atlanta."" ""His legacy will continue through his many friends, players and fans, as well as the rest of the NFL community,"" the family said. Between his passage through the Broncos, 1981 to 1992 and the Falcons, from 1997 to 2003, also led the New York Giants from 1993 to 1996. At just 37 when he took over as coach of the Broncos in 1981, he built a team around the quarterback. John elway who made three appearances in the Super bowl during his 12 years in office. But Denver never won a title under Reeves, being knocked out in his three trips to the title game. Similarly, Reeves has an NFL record of 201 games won, 174 losses and just two draws, and he is one of only seven coaches in NFL history with more than 200 wins. Reeves was a versatile player who played a key role in the Cowboys becoming an NFL powerhouse in the 1960s with Tom Landry, but his own coaching career, spanning three teams and 23 seasons , is where he really made his mark on the league. INFORMATION FROM AP WAS USED IN THIS REPORT","Dan Reeves, 1944 2022 The legendary football player and coach is gone at 77. James Joyner · Sunday, January 2, 2022 · 4 comments Washington Post (""Former NFL coach Dan Reeves dies at 77""): Former NFL coach Dan Reeves died Saturday at 77, his family and former teams announced. Reeves, a head coach for 23 seasons with the Denver Broncos, New York Giants and Atlanta Falcons, won 201 games in his NFL coaching career, including the postseason. Teaming with quarterback John Elway, Reeves led the Broncos to three Super Bowl appearances in four years (1987, 1988 and 1990) and then guided the Falcons to Super Bowl XXXIII in 1999, but his teams never won the big game, losing by a combined score of 170 59 in his four appearances. He was a part of nine Super Bowls as a player, head coach and assistant coach, the third most by an individual. Reeves did experience Super Bowl glory as a player and as an assistant coach. He played eight seasons with the Dallas Cowboys as an undrafted running back from 1965 to 1972 and helped the Cowboys win Super Bowl VI before retiring. He was the offensive coordinator for the Cowboys when they won Super Bowl XII. But his first opportunity to be a head coach came with the Broncos in 1981, when he was named the ninth coach in franchise history, making him the youngest head coach in the NFL at the time at 37. Reeves's stint with Denver was his most successful coaching tenure; he led the Broncos to six playoff berths and five AFC West titles in addition to the Super Bowl appearances. He's a member of the Broncos Ring of Fame. ""Reeves coached the Broncos with integrity, character and toughness along with sincere appreciation for his players and coaches,"" the franchise said in a statement, crediting the coach with setting ""the foundation for the Broncos' decade of dominance in the 1980s and championship tradition for years to come."" Over 11 seasons with the Giants and Falcons, he produced three more playoff seasons, including Atlanta's first appearance in the Super Bowl. The Falcons lost, 34 19, to Elway and the Broncos. ""Dan Reeves leaves a lasting legacy in our game as a player and coach. His track record of success in Dallas, Denver, New York and Atlanta over several decades speaks for itself, marking a long and successful life and career in football,"" Falcons owner Arthur Blank said in a statement. ""On behalf of the Atlanta Falcons I extend our condolences to Dan's family and friends as they mourn his passing."" Reeves was twice named coach of the year by the Associated Press (1993 with the Giants and 1998 with the Falcons) and has the ninth most regular season wins among coaches in NFL history (190). Among retired coaches, only Marty Schottenheimer won more games without being enshrined in the Hall of Fame. NYT (""Dan Reeves, Coach Who Reached (but Lost) Four Super Bowls, Dies at 77""): Dan Reeves, a former Dallas Cowboys running back who, as a coach, guided teams to four Super Bowls (although he lost them all), died on Saturday at his home in Atlanta. He was 77. The cause was complications of dementia, according to a family statement. Reeves played and coached with the Dallas Cowboys during a stellar period when they won two Super Bowls, one when he was a player coach and one when he was an offensive coordinator, working for Coach Tom Landry. After several seasons as an assistant to Landry, he was hired as the Broncos' head coach in 1981, replacing Red Miller. Over 12 seasons in Denver, his teams had a record of 110 73 1 and were among the best in the American Football Conference. Led by quarterback John Elway, they lost the Super Bowl in 1987, 1988 and 1990 by wide margins to the New York Giants, the Washington Redskins and the San Francisco 49ers. Reeves clashed with Elway over the Broncos' offensive scheme and disagreed with the team's owner, Pat Bowlen, over control of the team. Reeves fired his offensive coordinator, Mike Shanahan, in early 1992 for insubordination, believing that Shanahan had driven a wedge between him and Elway, who would later say it was ""hell"" playing for Reeves. Following an 8 8 season in 1992, Bowlen fired Reeves. ""When you own a football team,"" Reeves said afterward, ""you should be able to run the ball club the way you would like to."" Bowlen said that he could have renewed Reeves's contract but that within a year ""we both would have been miserable and at each other's throat."" Reeves was hired in early 1993 by the Giants, who had dismissed Ray Handley after a 6 10 season. ""When you've gone and lost three Super Bowls and that's what people will remember the most about you, that's what drives you,"" Reeves said at the news conference where he was introduced. ESPN (""Dan Reeves, former NFL coach and player, dies at 77""): Dan Reeves, who appeared in nine Super Bowls as a player, assistant coach and head coach, died at his home in Atlanta on Saturday. He was 77. Reeves is one of only 10 coaches to have won at least 190 regular season games in his career, and he guided two teams — the Denver Broncos and Atlanta Falcons — to the Super Bowl and was the head coach of the New York Giants for four seasons. With a 201 174 2 NFL coaching record overall, including the postseason, he is one of only nine coaches in NFL history with 200 total wins. His Super Bowl appearances as an individual have been topped only by quarterback Tom Brady and New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick. Dallas Morning News (""Once considered Tom Landry's heir apparent with Cowboys, Dan Reeves found greatness elsewhere""): There was a time many in the NFL assumed Reeves would be Landry's heir apparent. That never unfolded. But he did go on to coach Denver, the New York Giants and Atlanta, accumulate 201 regular season and postseason wins and lead the Broncos and Falcons to the Super Bowl. Reeves would play or coach in nine Super Bowls before his professional career was done. New England's Bill Belichick (12) and Tampa Bay's Tom Brady (10) are the only men with more appearances. Five of those trips — two as a player, three as an assistant coach — came with the Cowboys. His time in Dallas laid the foundation for the success he would enjoy for 23 seasons as one of the league's most respected head coaches. ""I think he knew where his future lay,"" Hall of Fame safety Cliff Harris said. ""It was going to be in coaching. Coach Landry saw that, too. ""He was the motivator and a smart guy that could direct a successful team."" A quarterback with the South Carolina Gamecocks, Reeves signed with the Cowboys as an undrafted rookie free agent in 1965 to play defense and special teams. He was shifted to halfback because of injuries and one year later led the league with 16 touchdowns. A serious knee injury in Week 4 of the '68 season altered his playing career and accelerated his path to coaching. Reeves was a player coach for three seasons before retiring as an active player with 1,990 rushing yards, 1,693 receiving yards and 42 touchdowns. ""If I were going to describe him as a player, he was a smart, technical guy who was a really good athlete that knew the system, knew football, knew how to run and make yardage,"" Harris said. ""The reason he could do that is he was a good athlete and smart. ""He got the Landry system, and Coach Landry knew he got the system."" Reeves would coach the offensive backfield, special teams, receivers and fill the role as the Cowboys offensive coordinator before leaving in '81 to replace Red Miller as Denver's head coach. While I was alive for Reeves' turn as a player with the Dallas Cowboys, he had retired by the time I started rooting for the team in earnest. And while he was the team's offensive coordinator the first few seasons I watched closely the media environment was very different then, so the assistants were nearly invisible. From afar, at least, he always seemed like a good guy and a top notch coach. And he really should be a Hall of Famer. Clark Judge makes the case for Sports Illustrated: Nobody has been in more Super Bowls than Dan Reeves. He played in two. He was an assistant in three. And he was a head coach in four. That should count for something. It should count for Hall of Fame consideration. Yeah, right, you say. So how many times was he the winning head coach? Answer: Zero. His Broncos lost three times, and his Falcons lost once. And big deal. But wait a minute, I hear you protest, doesn't the Pro Football Hall of Fame's board of selectors measure coaches … like quarterbacks …by their rings? In other words, shouldn't that 0 4 record disqualify Reeves from the conversation? Well, yes. Yes, coaches are measured for rings, but, no, Reeves' record doesn't disqualify him from anything but a phone call from the President. Quick, now, tell me how many Lombardi Trophies Marv Levy won? Answer: As many as Dan Reeves. He's 0 4. Yet it didn't keep Levy out of Canton. And what about Bud Grant? He went to four Super Bowls, too, and guess what? He didn't win, either. And he's in the Hall. But, people tell me, Levy's situation was unique because he went to four straight Super Bowls. Not only is that remarkable; it's never been duplicated. And they're right. But look what Reeves accomplished in Denver: He went to three Super Bowls in four years and was the only AFC coach in the 1980s to lead his team to consecutive Super Bowls. Reeves ranks eighth all time in coaching victories with 190. Nine times in his career he won 10 or more games. Three times he won 12 or more. He was 11 9 in the playoffs, won six division titles and was a two time NFL Coach of the Year. Yet he not only can't get into the Hall; he hasn't even been nominated as a finalist. You gotta be kidding. ""Not only Bud Grant and Marv Levy,"" Hall of Fame tight end Shannon Sharpe told the Denver Post, ""but, help me, my Super Bowl memory is a little foggy. What did George Allen win again?"" Uh huh. Zilch. And Allen was 2 5 in the playoffs. ""My biggest regret,"" Reeves once said, ""is that we didn't win a Super Bowl for Denver."" I understand. But that shouldn't preclude him from getting to Canton. Dan Marino didn't win one for Miami, either. And he went to only one. Dan Fouts and Warren Moon didn't. They went to none. But that didn't prevent them from going to the Hall. And it shouldn't prevent Dan Reeves. Oh, and one more thing: Reeves was one helluva player, too. He could run. He could catch. And he could pass, launching the longest completion of the ""Ice Bowl,"" a 50 yard touchdown strike to Lance Rentzel. He could score, too, setting a team record with four TDs in a 1967 game vs. Atlanta, putting up 16 touchdowns in his first year at running back and scoring via the pass, run and catch in a game against Philadelphia. Yeah, I know, that's not supposed to count. You either go into the Hall as a player, or you go in as a coach. Period. To which I say, ""Huh?"" That rule must change, and here's hoping it changes in time for Dan Reeves as good on the field as he was on the sidelines — to make the final cut to 15 so his credentials can be fairly evaluated. In the meantime, his coaching record speaks for itself. He was good enough to resurrect the Denver Broncos and put them in the Super Bowl. Three times, no less. He was good enough to turn around the floundering New York Giants and put them in the playoffs. And he was good enough to rebuild Atlanta and put it in its first … and only … Super Bowl. I've long argued that, given the massive size of NFL rosters, it's absurd to limit inductees to seven a year. It creates travesties like having Drew Pearson, the first team all decade wide receiver for the 1970s, having to wait almost forty years to get his gold jacket. It also means that coaches and players who retire to become television commentators go to the front of the line, because their names remain top of mind.

The developer of a worldwide famous computer antivirus software John McAfee was found dead in his Spanish prison cell Wednesday, just hours after his extradition to the United States had been approved. Preliminary reports indicate McAfee might have committed suicide. He was found lifeless at a penitentiary facility near Barcelona where he was being held pending extradition ""at around 7:00 p.m. local time,"" a spokeswoman for the Catalonia correctional service was quoted as saying. The 75 year old McAfee was wanted in his native United States for tax fraud. After making his fortune with his antivirus in the 1980s, McAfee became a cryptocurrency guru and was followed by close to a million people on Twitter. He was arrested in October 2020 at the Barcelona airport after the publication by a US attorney of an indictment against him for failing to declare millions of dollars from the promotion of cryptocurrencies, consulting services, conferences and copyright royalties for a documentary about his life. The US authorities had issued an arrest warrant to Interpol for allegedly pocketing more than 13 million dollars through fraudulent schemes on the internet and together with a close aide they were both being investigated for seven possible crimes of conspiracy to commit stock fraud and money laundering. Earlier Wednesday, Spain's National High Court had given the green light for his extradition. During his Spanish court appearance, he claimed to have paid ""millions of dollars in taxes"" and said he was the victim of political persecution for having denounced corruption. McAfee's tax debt in the United States is said to amount to more than four million dollars. In 1989 he founded McAfee Associates, which for a few years called itself Network Associates and which eventually became the McAfee company. In 2010 he launched a new project focused on biosecurity at the helm of the Belize based company QuorumEx. Categories: Politics, International, United States. Tags: John McAfee, Spain, tax fraud.","McAfee antivirus creator dead in Spanish prison after facing charges in Memphis federal court ARITZ PARRA, RENATA BRITO and BARRY HATTON MADRID (AP) — John McAfee, the creator of the McAfee antivirus software, has been found dead in his cell in a jail near Barcelona, a government official told The Associated Press on Wednesday. Authorities said the cause of death was being investigated. Hours earlier, a Spanish court issued a preliminary ruling in favor of the 75 year old tycoon's extradition to the United States to face tax related criminal charges that could carry decades in prison. Security personnel at the Brians 2 penitentiary near the northeastern Spanish city tried to revive him, but the jail's medical team finally certified his death, a statement from the regional Catalan government said. ""A judicial delegation has arrived to investigate the causes of death,"" the statement said, adding that ""Everything points to death by suicide."" The statement didn't identify McAfee by name, but said he was a 75 year old U.S. citizen awaiting extradition to his country. A Catalan government source familiar with the event who was not authorized to be named in media reports confirmed to the AP that the dead man was McAfee. Spain's National Court on Monday ruled in favor of extraditing McAfee, who had argued in a hearing earlier this month that the charges against him by prosecutors in Tennessee were politically motivated and that he would spend the rest of his life in prison if he was returned to the U.S. The court's ruling was made public on Wednesday and was open for appeal. Any final extradition order would also need to get approval from the Spanish Cabinet. Tennessee prosecutors charged 75 year old McAfee with evading taxes after failing to report income made from promoting cryptocurrencies while he did consultancy work, as well as income from speaking engagements and selling the rights to his life story for a documentary. The entrepreneur was arrested last October at Barcelona's international airport. A judge ordered at that time that McAfee should be held in jail while awaiting the outcome of a hearing on extradition. McAfee led an eccentric life after he sold his stake in the antivirus software company named after him in the early 1990s. He twice ran long shot bids for U.S. president and was a participant in Libertarian Party presidential debates in 2016. In July 2019, McAfee was released from detention in the Dominican Republic after he and five others were suspected of traveling on a yacht carrying high caliber weapons, ammunition and military style gear, officials on the Caribbean island said at the time. McAfee was charged last October in Tennessee with evading taxes after failing to report income made from promoting cryptocurrencies while he did consulting work, made speaking engagements and sold the rights to his life story for a documentary. The criminal charges carry a prison sentence of up to 30 years. The last post from McAfee's Twitter account was a retweet of a Father's Day message from his wife Janice McAfee. ""These eight months John has spent in prison in Spain have been especially hard on his overall health both mentally and physically, as well as financially, but he is undeterred from continuing to speak truth to power,"" it said.

(May 25, 2020) More than a quarter century after the Gulf War, female veterans who saw combat have nearly a twofold risk of reporting more than 20 total medical symptoms, like cognition and respiratory troubles, than their fellow female veterans who were not deployed, investigators report. A sizeable percentage of the female combat veterans still report neurological symptoms; about two thirds report difficulty remembering new information and trouble concentrating, investigators report in the Journal of Women's Health. An association with more headaches among the combat veterans also was reported and there were ""strong associations"" between deployment status and respiratory symptoms with 39% of combat veterans still reporting difficulty breathing or shortness of breath. More than half also report a low tolerance for heat and cold. ""It's been over 25 years since the war ended and these are very persistent health outcomes,"" says Dr. Steven S. Coughlin, interim chief of the Division of Epidemiology in the Medical College of Georgia Department of Population Health Sciences. ""This tells us that the way the Gulf War illness manifests itself may be different in female than male veterans, so it's important to take gender into account,"" says Coughlin. Twenty years ago, female Gulf War veterans were reporting similar problems, investigators say. The newly reported findings indicate the women are showing increased frequency of symptoms over time and above the rate that would be expected with normal aging, the investigators say. Their reported symptoms correspond with higher rates of diabetes, osteoporosis, thyroid problems, asthma and irritable bowel syndrome in this and similar groups. Additional studies are needed to find biomarkers of Gulf War illness in these former soldiers and effective treatments, they write. ""We think this has a lot of importance for the health of these veterans and hopefully, when combined with information from other studies, it will lead to improved treatment,"" Coughlin says. Three hundred and one female Gulf War veterans from all military branches participated in the study, including 203 who were deployed and 98 who were not sent directly into a war zone. Other persistent problems war zone veterans report include about a third saying they frequently cough when they do not have a cold. Many of their reported symptoms fit the definition of Gulf War illness, which includes having at least three of six symptom categories that include fatigue, neurological/cognitive/mood problems, pain as well as respiratory, gastrointestinal and skin problems. Younger, non white, female Army veterans were likely to report the most symptoms, they say. Their significant symptom burden would likely impact the veterans' quality of life and require medical evaluation and treatment, Coughlin and his colleagues write. ""We are trying to fill in this gap in the published literature about Gulf War illness among women veterans because they have been greatly understudied,"" Coughlin says, referencing the first conflict in which the United States included a sizeable female contingent directly in warfare. The gender differences they are finding are consistent with earlier studies as well as other current ones coming out of Florida based Nova Southeastern University, for example, where they are conducting a clinical trial to try to reverse some of the ill effects, he says. The findings also are more evidence that the female veterans of the Gulf War may have more chronic health issues and conditions than other groups of women generally or female veterans specifically. Coughlin theorizes that females may be more susceptible to some of the wartime hazards because on average their body size is smaller and because of other differences in physiology. ""We can only speculate,"" he adds. When troops started to come home from the Middle East following the conflict that lasted from August 1990 through February 1991, they reported a constellation of symptoms, including headaches, gastrointestinal complaints, skin ailments, forgetfulness, fatigue, particularly after exertion, and musculoskeletal pain, says Coughlin, who served as a senior epidemiologist with the Department of Veterans Affairs Central Office in Washington, D.C. The leading theory early on was that it was a psychogenic illness, somewhat similar to the PTSD experienced by many Vietnam War veterans. Now the consensus is that much of it results from the neurological impact of neurotoxins soldiers on the frontline were exposed to, Coughlin says. ""They were inundated with pesticides, there are a lot of biting flies and pests in that part of the world so they had uniforms infused with pesticides, a lot of them even wore a dog's flea collar for extra protection,"" he says. Soldiers also were asked to take pyridostigmine bromide, a drug given to patients with myasthenia gravis to improve muscle strength, prophylactically to help protect them from nerve agents in field, but the drug itself is mildly toxic to nerves and there is some evidence that, in combination with some of the insecticides used, it becomes more potent. ""Every time the alarms went off, they would have to take these little white pills,"" Coughlin says. There were other environmental toxins as well, like blown up munitions factories and low dose exposure to sarin nerve gas and others. ""It's similar to what you see among agricultural workers exposed to pesticides,"" he notes. The veterans also were exposed to hazards such as smoke from oil well fires and burn pits used to incinerate waste, the investigators write. The new study looked at the frequency and patterns of health symptoms in the female veterans as well as military service and lifestyle. The investigators theorized that symptoms associated with Gulf War illness would be more prominent in the women who saw conflict. They found the deployed veterans were significantly more likely to report seven symptoms consistent with Gulf War illness, including low tolerance for heat or cold, difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, frequent coughing without having a cold, difficulty concentrating and remembering recent information, feeling down or depressed and anxious, the investigators write. Those deployed were more than twice as likely to report more total symptoms and nonwhites — including American Indians, Alaska natives as well as Asian Americans and Pacific Islands Americans — were four times more likely to report symptoms than whites. Older women were less likely than younger women to report symptoms and those enlisted in the Air Force and Navy were significantly less likely to report more symptoms than those in the Army. Participants in the study were a mean age of early 50s and other demographics, like race, ethnicity and education, were similar, but those who saw combat were more likely to have served in the Army or Navy and less likely to have served in the Air Force. They were taken from a national cohort of 1,318 Gulf War veterans created from the Veterans Affairs Cooperative Studies Program 585 Gulf War Era Cohort and Biorepository pilot study. Outcomes of female veterans in the group have not been reported separately. Women comprised 7% of the 700,000 military personnel to serve in the Gulf War, the largest number of women to serve in a war zone in U.S. military history at that time. The influx of the some 50,000 female Gulf War veterans resulted in the establishment of specialty clinics for them at VA hospitals. Evidence indicates about 19% of women veterans still have delayed or unmet health care needs, possibly because of expanded military roles for women, including increased exposure to combat, the investigators write. Female veterans who have been involved in conflicts since the Vietnam War report higher rates of poor sleep quality, fatigue, insomnia, chronic pain, including headache and musculoskeletal complaints, respiratory problems and skin problems, as well as cognitive and mood related complaints, Coughlin and his colleagues write. Coauthors include Dr. Vahé Heboyan in the Department of Interdisciplinary Health Sciences in the College of Allied Health Sciences at Augusta University as well as colleagues at the Boston University School of Public Health and the Uniformed Services University Graduate School of Nursing in Bethesda.

Alyssa Powell/Business Insider When you're a Los Angeles based entertainment and also lifestyle journalist like me, you often find yourself at the Four Seasons Hotel Los Angeles at Beverly Hills . That's since the resort is well recognized as one of the most effective seen and be seen places for a functioning go to in addition to a power lunch or supper in town. However it's not all tight business and rule. As a 4 Seasons, the resort rates to families as well as travelers of all kinds seeking the uniformity of a popular global deluxe chain. Obviously with the passing star and also bold faced name, it's additionally excellent for people enjoying. I count myself lucky to call it something of a second home in community. I'll always remember the moment I saw with my partner for a staycation when I was 9 months expecting, or much more recently, over the cheery holiday when the usual areas were festooned with flower and design setups from celebrity florist Jeff Leatham. As such, it's not a surprise it made our list of the ideal hotels in Los Angeles for 2020. Costs for entry level rooms here start in the $400s, according to on the internet search results at the time of publication. On my current Xmas stay, I remained in a mid tier Deluxe Veranda King space, which was comped for evaluation objectives, but typically books for $595. I've always seen typical rooms, which are really larger, and with a lower price factor. Unless you're traveling with family members or planning to entertain in room, in my experience, a standard sized room is the most effective worth for luxury lodgings that are spacious, extravagant, as well as prime for people watching. $155 and also upFor a 92 year old hotel, the Hotel Figueroa is very ""on pattern,"" as marketers like to state. It was developed by the Y.W.C.A. as a solely female hostelry a spot where solitary women, consisting of aspiring starlets, can stay without fear of the Harvey Weinsteins of the world. The Figueroa supposedly even gave the United States its initial women hotel supervisor: Maude Bouldin, a motorcyle riding tour de pressure. Then the long decrease of downtown Los Angeles took a toll. By 2014, when brand new proprietors started a $60 million deluxe overhaul, the resort had a Morocco by way of Sweden motif (don't ask) and also was accommodating discount German excursion groups. The remodelling, which was finished earlier this year, leans into the Figueroa's feminist background, with artwork from regional lady musicians on the walls as well as common spaces made to host women centric ""beauty parlors.""The Fig, as citizens know it, sits nearby from L.A. . The Grammy Gallery is also located there. Midtown stretches in the opposite direction, offering the gentrified food lover holy place Grand Central Market and the restored Theater at Ace Resort, which hosts indie bands and displays art films. The spacious Blossom Market to the south is eye popping as well as only charges $1 admission on Saturdays. Priced at $359.20 for a Saturday evening in very early November, not consisting of tax, our ""timeless queen"" room on a top floor seemed like a storage room, and the sight was mostly of a wall surface. A generously equipped minibar occupied a lot of the real storage room, leaving no room for a luggage. (My partner, Joe, sarcastically kept in mind that the space did include two prophylactics, nonetheless.) The thermostat appeared to have a mind of its own, that made me homicidal. On the bonus side, there was a basket of totally free treats Oreos, Red Vines and also the bed was comfy. The space was additionally extremely silent. The bare walls resembled incomplete cement and also among the two lights beside the mirror was missing; a bare bulb just dangled there. Activating the shower required the navigating of 2 counterproductive bars, and it was so dark in that corner of the bathroom that it was hard to tell which container was shampoo as well as which one was body wash. Bouldin!Before supper, we picked up drinks (a martini for Joe and also a cucumber mint lemonade for me) at Rick's, a charming indoor outdoor lounge. As ""Juicy"" by the Notorious B.I.G. used the sound system, we by a crackling fire place as well as wondered at the monumental, 50 year old cactuses lining the resort's coffin shaped swimming pool (). Our web server, Christopher, patiently addressed my 700 inquiries regarding the tiny plates and also ""pintxos"" on the food selection. We inhaled the fried kale lollipop with dill crme frache ($10) and plaything box squash with avocado and olives ($14) before proceeding to meals, consisting of deep fried poultry with a barbequed peach and jalapeo salad ($29) spicy and delicious, also if the fruit was inedibly unripe . We bought room solution utilizing an iPad set down on the nightstand as well as were given a 35 minute delay time. It took a hr as well as 14 mins for our simple order of coffee, yogurt and a ham, egg and also cheese sandwich to show up. The server shrugged when I grumbled as well as pointed out that the tip was currently consisted of. Pet dogs rate to stay with their proprietors for a $50 cost. The resort has a stylish, 24 hour gym furnished with treadmills, an elliptical device, kettlebells as well as weights, among various other items. Private yoga classes and fitness trainers are available upon demand (). High speed Wi Fi is complimentary. Upscale boutique hotels are all about focus to information, which seems to be an operate in progression at the Figueroa. ""Facilities and that it was very tidy.

PLEASE CLICK ON ""Rules/Docs"" FOR THE CURRENT MAJOR B RULES MAJOR B LEAGUE RULES The Major B League is one of two Major League levels in Brookline Youth Baseball (BYB). To be eligible this spring, a player must be 10, 11, or 12 years old on August 31 of this year. A player who turns 10 in September or later, or turns 13 in August or earlier, is not eligible. League Format The Major B League is a competitive league that emphasizes skill development, team play, and sportsmanship. At this level, players are taught the various positions on the field and the responsibilities of those positions, and all players are given a chance to play different positions over the course of the season. The number of teams and number of players on each team are determined by the league vice president (VP), along with members of the BYB Board of Directors, based on registration numbers. During the regular season, each team plays two games per week — on weeknights (no earlier than 5:30 p.m.) and Sunday afternoons (starting times vary). The regular season is followed by playoffs,which conclude by the final day of the public school year. The playoff format is determined by the league VP, and all teams qualify. Regular season and playoff games are scheduled by the league VP. Practices are scheduled by each team's head coach according to coach, player, and field availability. Player Selection/Team Formation A player is assigned to Major B after thorough observation, evaluation, and discussion. Those involved in the decision include: the Major B League, Major A League, and Minor League VPs; members of the BYB Board of Directors who have knowledge of the player; the player's coach during last year's spring, summer, and/or fall season; the player's instructor during any recent BYB clinics he/she attended; and coaches who observed the player at this year's preseason tryout. BYB's goal is to place each player at the level where he/she has the best chance for a successful season and a positive baseball experience. Teams are assembled by the Major B League VP, who consults the Minor League VPs and Major B coaches. The objective is to construct teams that are comparable in talent so that the competition among them is as balanced as possible. Major B League umpires are usually current or former BYB players, between ages 13 and 17, who have been trained in umpiring. If no assigned umpire arrives by the time the game is scheduled to begin, the two head coaches may, upon mutual agreement, select one or two of those in attendance (including themselves) to umpire the game. Before each game, head coaches must meet with the umpire at home plate to review ground rules and other rules that are unique to BYB's Major B League. During a game, only a head coach may discuss a play with an umpire. The head coach of the home team is responsible for paying the umpire. Bats and Baseballs Only wooden bats are allowed in this league; aluminum bats are not permitted. Wooden bats used in a game must be between 27 and 32 inches in length and no more than 32 ounces in weight. Regulation hard balls are used in all practices and games. Any questions or concerns regarding the Major B League should be directed to the league VP. Questions or concerns about umpiring should be directed to the VP in charge of umpires. See the BYB website (www.brooklineyouthbaseball.org) for a list of VPs and their email addresses. The Major B League uses the official Little League Baseball playing rules as a standard guide, amended by the following game rules. Violation of any rule may result in forfeiture of a game, ejection from a game, and/or suspension or expulsion from BYB. BYB's principal goal is to ensure an atmosphere of sportsmanship and civility. Other objectives, such as winning and personal performance, are secondary. The following Code of Conduct, which is based on these priorities, applies to all BYB games and practices. All players, coaches, and spectators must: Treat other players, coaches, spectators, and umpires with respect. Refrain from: criticizing, insulting, taunting, blaming, or threatening another person; using foul language; and physically abusing another person. Accept the decisions of umpires without complaint. (A head coach may question the application of a rule, but judgment calls may not be argued.) Treat all equipment with care. In addition: Players must play by the rules of the game and accept coaches' decisions without complaint. Head coaches must monitor the behavior of their players, assistant coaches, and spectators, and must act immediately to put a stop to unsportsmanlike behavior when it occurs. All coaches must follow the rules, treat each player as an individual, recognize and reward effort as well as talent, and promote sportsmanship. Spectators are encouraged to cheer and show appreciation for good plays and efforts made by both teams, and may not challenge or criticize a coach's decision. In the event that a player, coach, or spectator violates BYB's Code of Conduct, both the umpire and the league VP are authorized to dismiss the individual from the field, and to stop the game and declare a forfeit if the individual does not comply. In addition, BYB reserves the right to impose further sanctions, including expulsion from the BYB program (without a refund of registration fees to players or their families). Game Format Major B League games are designed to allow players to apply the skills they've learned during practices. These games are competitive, and scores are recorded. All games are scheduled to last six innings. In the event of inclement weather during the day of a game, head coaches are responsible for contacting each other to determine whether the game can be played. Head coaches are also responsible for calling the Town of Brookline's Recreation Information Line (730 2083 or 730 2084) to find out if the fields are closed because of poor conditions; the recorded message on this line is typically updated by 11:00 a.m. on weekdays and 7:00 a.m. on weekends. Before a game, the head coaches have the authority to decide whether the game can be played (if the fields are open); if the head coaches cannot reach an agreement, the head coach of the home team has final say. Once a game has begun, the umpire has the authority to stop the game due to inclement weather or poor field conditions, after consulting both head coaches. (Note: The most important consideration must be the safety of the players.) Postponements If the two head coaches are unable to reach each other directly, only the home team's head coach may postpone a game on his/her own. In this situation, he/she must immediately leave a voice message notifying both the visiting team's head coach and the league VP of the postponement, or risk losing the game by forfeit. If a game is postponed before the teams have arrived at the field, the home team's head coach must notify the league VP of the postponement as soon as possible so that the league VP has time to notify the coordinator of umpires. (Ideally, the league VP should be notified three hours before the scheduled start time, but this isn't always possible because of sudden changes in the weather.) If the umpire arrives at the field because BYB provided late notice or no notice of a postponement, the home team coach must pay the umpire the full amount. A postponed game must be rescheduled at a later date, time, and location agreed upon by the two head coaches and the league VP. The league VP is responsible for providing an umpire at the rescheduled game. Game Equipment The home team is required to provide bases for each game. Both teams must provide their own bats and batting helmets, although each team must share batting helmets if the other team doesn't have enough. Each team is required to provide a new game ball to the umpire before the start of the game. Before each game, head coaches must meet with the umpire at home plate to review ground rules and other rules that are unique to BYB's Major B League. Coaches and Spectators Coaches are allowed to choose two assistant coaches and a scorekeeper to be in the bench area during games. Only head coaches and assistant coaches are allowed on the field during a break in play to instruct players. Only head coaches, assistant coaches, and players are allowed to coach from the first and third base coaching boxes (players must wear helmets). Only a head coach is allowed to discuss a play with an umpire. Spectators who are not coaches must watch the game in the areas designated for spectators, and are not allowed on the field or in the bench area with the team. No spectator may stand behind the backstop during a game. Fielding a Team A team must be able to field at least eight players to play a game. If a team cannot field at least eight players when the game is scheduled to begin, the start of the game may be delayed for 10 minutes in order to allow late players to arrive. If, after 10 minutes, the team still cannot field at least eight players, that team must forfeit the game. If an injury or early departure leaves a team unable to field at least eight players at any time after a game has begun, that team must forfeit the game. (Note: A shorthanded team may not borrow players from the opposing team.) If a coach knows ahead of time that he/she will not be able to field at least nine players for a game and would like to borrow a player from the Minor League, the coach must first contact the Major B League VP, who will request a player from a Minor League VP. Only a player who does not have a Minor League game on the same day is allowed to play in a Major B game. (Note: Minor League players may not pitch in a Major B game and must bat at the bottom of the batting order.) During each game, each player must play in the field for at least four innings and must be allowed to play positions in the infield and the outfield, except when: The game is stopped prior to six innings of play because of inclement weather, poor field conditions, or darkness. The coach benches a player for disciplinary reasons such as missing games and/or practices without notifying the coach, insubordination, or disruptive behavior. The coach must notify the opposing coach of the disciplinary action before the start of the game. (Note: Poor play is not a valid reason for benching a player.) Each player must sit on the bench for at least one inning per game, except when: Not enough players are available. Each time a coach doesn't have enough players available to comply with the must sit requirement, he/she must allow a different player to play a complete game. No player, except a catcher (see the next bullet), may play two complete games until each player on the team has played one complete game. An injury to or absence of a player leaves no back up catcher available. In this case, the coach may keep the same player at the catcher position for the entire game. The coach must inform the opposing coach of the injury or absence prior to the game or immediately when the injury occurs. (Note: Only an injury to or absence of all back up catchers permits one player to catch an entire game, and each team must have at least two catchers to help prevent this situation.) A pitcher may not pitch more than four innings in a game under any circumstances. Substitutions and Mound Visits As long as playing time requirements are met, players may be freely substituted throughout the game — except at pitcher. All fielding changes, except pitching changes and substitutions due to injury, must be made at the start of an inning. No fielding substitutions may be made in the middle of an inning unless it involves a pitcher switching places with another fielder. A ""mound visit"" occurs any time an umpire calls time out to allow a coach to speak with the pitcher, or to speak with a position player who then speaks with the pitcher before the next pitch. Coaches are allowed one free mound visit per inning to speak with each pitcher. A second mound visit to the same pitcher in the same inning requires the coach to replace the pitcher. (Note: If a coach replaces a pitcher during a mound visit and speaks with the new pitcher before leaving the mound, the visit does not count as a mound visit to the new pitcher.) A pitcher who is removed from the mound may not re enter the game as a pitcher, but may re enter the game at another position. Other infielders (but not outfielders) may huddle with the coach on the mound during mound visits. However, the umpire may direct the players back to their positions and the coach back to the bench if, in the umpire's opinion, the game is being delayed unnecessarily. Bench Area The on deck batter may not hold a bat while waiting in the on deck area. All players who are not at bat or on deck must remain on the bench at all times, unless warming up to pitch. Pitchers must warm up away from the bench area: down the foul line, in foul territory, adjacent to the outfield nearest their bench. Spectators who are not coaches must watch the game in the areas designated for spectators, and are not allowed on the field or in the bench area with the team. No player, coach, or spectator may stand behind the backstop during a game. The following pitching rules are in force during the regular season, and in the playoffs unless adjusted by the league VP. If the league VP adjusts these rules for the playoffs, he/she will inform the league's head coaches before the playoffs begin. These restrictions are designed to protect pitchers' throwing arms from overuse. A team that violates a pitching rule is subject to disciplinary action, which may include forfeiture of the game in which the violation occurred and/or suspension of the coach. Maximum innings for each pitcher: Per game: 5 Per pitching week (Sunday Saturday): 6 Important notes about innings limits: Any inning in which a pitcher throws at least one pitch to a batter counts as a full inning for that pitcher. If a game is stopped before it has become an official game, the innings pitched still count toward each pitcher's total innings for the week. Rest Requirements The following rest requirements remain in force even when a new pitching week has begun (in other words, the start of a new pitching week does not eliminate the rest requirement). Note that players may not pitch on consecutive days. Innings Pitched in a Game Full Calendar Days of Rest Required Example 1 3 1 A player who pitches 4 innings on Friday may not pitch again until Tuesday. Pitch Limits In addition to abiding by the mandatory innings limits and rest requirements, each head coach must record the number of pitches thrown by each pitcher on his/her team during each game, and must report each pitcher's pitch count to the league VP after the game. Coaches are expected to limit the number of pitches each pitcher throws according to the pitch maximums in the following table, and to verify ongoing pitch counts with the opposing coach after each half inning. BYB reserves the right to discipline any coach who allows a pitcher to exceed these limits. Pitches per Day Pitches per Week Before May 18 60 80 On or After May 18 80 100 Prohibited Pitches Any pitch that entails the snapping or turning of the wrist — such as a Curveball or Slider — is prohibited. When done incorrectly or too often, this type of delivery is likely to lead to forearm and elbow injuries. The intent of this rule is not to keep a player from throwing a pitch that changes direction, but to keep him/her from snapping or turning the wrist during the delivery of the pitch. Therefore, a pitch that changes direction but does not entail snapping or turning the wrist, such as a Two Seam Fastball or a Circle Change Up, is allowed. (Note: Head coaches are responsible for ensuring that the umpire is aware of this rule before the game begins.) If a pitcher snaps or turns the wrist during delivery, the umpire must issue a warning to the pitcher. If the batter swings at and misses the pitch or hits into an out, the pitch is called a ball and the batter continues his/her at bat; however, if the batter hits the ball and reaches base safely, he/she may remain on base. Upon a second violation of the rule by the same pitcher, the pitcher must be removed from the mound but may remain in the game at another position. Balks are not called. Intentional walks are allowed only if first base is open and there are less than two outs. A pitcher who hits two batters in an inning or three in a game must be removed from the mound. A pitcher who is removed from the mound may not re enter the game as a pitcher, but may remain in or re enter the game at another position. Each player at this position must wear a complete set of catcher's equipment: helmet, face mask, throat guard, chest protector, catcher's mitt, shin guards, and protective cup. If a catcher, when his/her team is batting, reaches base or is on base with two outs in an inning, the coach has the option to temporarily replace the catcher with a pinch runner so that the catcher can begin putting on the catcher's equipment. This rule is designed to allow the next half inning to begin without delay, and applies only if the catcher will return to the catcher position. The pinch runner must be the player who made the most recent out. Each batter must wear a helmet in the on deck area and throughout the at bat. Batting Order Each team must provide the opposing team's scorekeeper with a batting order before the game. With the exception of players who become injured or leave the field early, all players must remain in the same spot in the order throughout the game — even when not playing in the field. If a player must be removed from the order because of injury or early departure, the removal must be reported to the opposing scorekeeper and the player's spot in the order may be skipped for the rest of the game without an out being recorded. Players who arrive after the game has begun must be added to the end of the order and reported to the opposing scorekeeper immediately. When a player fails to bat in his/her proper spot in the order: If the mistake is detected and pointed out by either head coach before the at bat is completed, the improper batter is replaced by the proper batter, who inherits any balls and strikes that had already been called. If the head coach of the fielding team appeals to the umpire after the improper batter has concluded the at bat but before the first pitch to the next batter, the proper batter (the one who failed to bat in turn) is called out. In this case, the improper batter may not remain on base, any advances by base runners that resulted from a ball hit into play by the improper batter are nullified, and the batting order resumes with the batter who would normally bat after the proper batter, even if it's the same batter who just batted improperly. If the head coach of the fielding team appeals after the first pitch to the next batter, the improper batter remains on base, no batter is called out, base runner advances are not nullified, and the batting order resumes with the batter who would normally bat after the improper batter. Bunts/Sacrifice Flies/Dropped third Strikes Bunting is allowed; a bunt into foul territory after the batter already has two strikes is a strike out. Sacrifice fly balls, in which a base runner tags up and advances to the next base after the ball is caught, are allowed. A batter may not advance to first base on a wild pitch or passed ball on a third strike. Infield Fly/Hidden Ball The Infield Fly Rule is not enforced in this league. If a pop up is dropped in the infield, base runners may advance and fielders may record a force out. However, in the best interest of sportsmanship and fair play, coaches may not teach their infielders to purposely drop pop ups in an attempt to force out a lead runner or create a double play or triple play. If, in the umpire's opinion, a fielder purposely drops a pop up: All base runners, including the batter, are allowed to advance one base. The fielding team's head coach must explain the rule to his/her players. The umpire must report the incident to the league VP. BYB does not allow hidden ball plays designed to deceive base runners at any level of play. Base Runners Each base runner must wear a helmet until he/she returns to the bench. Leading and Stealing Leading is not allowed in this league. A player who takes a lead must receive a warning on the first offense and be called out on the second offense. Stealing of second base and third base is allowed, but the base runner may not leave the base until the ball crosses home plate. If a base runner leaves a base early and steals successfully, the base runner must return to the base where he/she started; however, if a base runner leaves a base early and is thrown out trying to steal, the base runner is out. Base runners may not advance if the pitcher is standing on any part of the mound with the ball. Base runners may lead off of first and second base after the ball passes the batter. Base runners are prohibited from leading off of third base at any time. A base runner may not steal home plate or advance from third base to home plate on a wild pitch or passed ball. If a base runner is on third base when the pitcher delivers a pitch, he or she may advance to home plate only if the ball is put in play by the batter. Clarification: A base runner at third base may not advance from third base to home plate on an attempted put out of a runner stealing second base, an attempted pick off of any base runner, or an errant return throw from the catcher to the pitcher. Clarification: A base runner on first base attempts a steal of second base and the catcher throws the ball into the outfield. The runner then attempts to take third base and the center fielder throws the ball out of play attempting to make the out at third base. The base runner is now entitled to home plate because the runner was not on third base when the pitcher delivered the pitch. Sliding/Avoiding Contact A base runner may not intentionally make contact with a fielder. A base runner who, in the umpire's opinion, initiates contact with a fielder anywhere on the base paths may be called out. To prevent collisions, a base runner approaching second base, third base, or home plate must slide feet first if a throw is made in an attempt to get the base runner out — even if the throw is late or off target. A base runner who does not slide may be called out by the umpire if the base runner makes contact with a fielder. A base runner who slides head first when advancing to a base may be called out by the umpire. Head first slides are permitted only when a base runner is diving back to a base to avoid being doubled off on a line drive or to avoid being picked off. (Note: A base runner may not slide when advancing to first base.) Advancing on Throws If a fielder causes a ball to leave the playing field — beyond the backstop or the side boundaries (usually the team benches) agreed upon before the game — each base runner is awarded the base he/she is going to plus one additional base. When the ball is within the playing field, base runners advance at their own risk. Pinch Runners Mercy Rule An inning must end when the batting team scores 10 runs or the fielding team makes three outs, whichever occurs first. The 10 run rule, however, does not apply during the final inning of play. The inning is not over after a team bats around the order — only after 10 runs have been scored. If the score is tied after six innings, play continues until one team has more total runs than the other after the bottom half of an extra inning. If the score is still tied when darkness, weather, or the scheduled start of another game causes the game to be stopped: If it's a regular season game, the game is complete and considered a tie. If it's a playoff game, the game must be concluded at a later date, time, and location agreed upon by the two head coaches and the league VP. Prior to May 15, an inning may not be started after 7:30 p.m. After that date, an inning may not be started after 7:50 p.m. If, in the umpire's opinion, after consulting both head coaches, an inning is unlikely to be completed in daylight, the game must be stopped before the start of that inning. Under no circumstances may a game be continued when it's difficult for any player to see the ball. The umpire is authorized to stop a game because of darkness at any time. If a game is official and is stopped in the middle of an inning, the score reverts to what it was at the end of the last completed inning. Official Game A game is considered official after two and a half innings have been played when the home team is leading, or after three full innings otherwise. Partial Game If a game must be discontinued because of inclement weather, poor field conditions, or darkness before it becomes an official game, it must be resumed at a later date, time, and location agreed upon by the two head coaches and the league VP. Resumed Game A partial game that's resumed must continue from the exact point where it left off: the same half of the same inning, with the same batter, batting orders, base runners, pitchers, and fielders. Partial game players who are unavailable for the resumed game may be replaced by other available players who were not in the field or in the lineup when the partial game was stopped. However, a pitcher who had been removed from the partial game before it was stopped may not pitch in the resumed game. The league VP is responsible for providing an umpire at the resumed game. Game Recording and Reporting Each team is required to keep score. Coaches/scorekeepers should meet after each half inning to ensure that they agree on the score, and to notify each other of lineup changes and substitutions. The head coach of the winning team (or the home team if the game ends in a tie) is responsible for reporting the following to the league VP within 24 hours after the game: The winner and score of the game (the score of a forfeit is recorded as 6 0) The number of innings played The numbers of innings pitched by each pitcher for both teams Each head coach should also report any inappropriate behavior by coaches, players, or spectators. Rule Violations, Disputes, and Protests A coach who notices that the opposing team is about to violate a rule (such as a playing time rule) must notify the opposing coach immediately. It is not acceptable to wait until the rule has been violated in an attempt to win by forfeit; this is not consistent with the spirit of youth baseball or the objectives of BYB. If a rule violation has occurred: The head coach who observes the violation should first bring it to the attention of the opposing head coach and, if possible, resolve the issue without involving the umpire. If the issue cannot be resolved between the two head coaches, they must then consult the umpire. For certain violations, such as batting out of order or use of an illegal bat, the umpire must be notified immediately after the conclusion of the at bat in which the violation occurred, before the first pitch to the next batter (see BATTING ORDER for more details). After the umpire makes a decision to resolve the dispute, the coaches must abide by that decision and must resume play and complete the game. The umpire has final authority while the game is in progress, and his or her decision cannot be reversed during the course of the game without his or her consent. If a head coach disagrees with the umpire's decision and wants to elevate the issue to the league VP, he or she must: Formally protest the game before resuming play. To do this, the coach must write the word ""protest"" in his or her scorebook, record the game details at the time of the protest (inning, score, outs, base runners), and have the umpire sign the score book. Any other form of protest, such as refusing to resume play (except when the safety of the players is compromised), is not allowed and may result in a forfeit against the protesting team and further discipline against that team's head coach. Contact the league VP within two hours after the conclusion of the game to complete the protest. The league VP will then take whatever steps are necessary to resolve the dispute fairly, and will make a decision that may include allowing the final score to stand, replaying some or all of the game, or awarding a forfeit to overturn the outcome of the game. Note: A coach may not protest a game after the conclusion of the game without following the protest process described above. Therefore, any rule violation or dispute that is not brought to the attention of the opposing head coach and the umpire while the game is in progress cannot be used as grounds for a protest after the game has ended. Standings and Playoff Seedings Standings are determined using each team's Total Points (win = two points; tie = one point). If two teams are tied, the following tie breakers are applied in the order shown: Winning Percentage (ties are ignored in calculating winning percentage) Win/Loss Record: head to head Runs Scored minus Runs Allowed: head to head Win/Loss Record: versus the next best seed Runs Scored minus Runs Allowed: versus the next best seed","MAJOR A LEAGUE RULES The Major A League is the more competitive of the two Major League levels in Brookline Youth Baseball (BYB). To be eligible this spring, a player must be 10, 11 or 12 years old on April 30 of the current year. A player who turns 10 after May 1, or turns 13 earlier than April 30, is not eligible. League Format The Major A League is a competitive league that emphasizes skill development, team play, and sportsmanship. At this level, players are taught the various positions on the field and the responsibilities of those positions, and all players are given a chance to play different positions over the course of the season. The league is made up of six teams. During the regular season, each team plays two or three games per week — on weeknights (no earlier than 5:30 p.m.) and Sunday afternoons (starting times vary). The regular season is followed by playoffs, which conclude by the final day of the public school year. The playoffs consist of three rounds of best of three game series, and all teams qualify. Regular season and playoff games are scheduled by the league VP. Practices are scheduled by each team's head coach according to coach, player, and field availability. Player Selection/Team Formation A player is assigned to Major A after thorough observation, evaluation, and discussion. Those involved in the decision include: the Major A League and Major B League VPs; members of the BYB Board of Directors who have knowledge of the player; the player's coach during last year's spring, summer, and/or fall season; the player's instructor during any recent BYB clinics he/she attended; and coaches who observed the player at this year's preseason tryout. While the preseason tryout is only one piece of the evaluation process, a player who does not attend a tryout may be less likely to be assigned to Major A. (Note: Players who were on a Major A team last spring and are still age eligible for Major A this spring are not required to attend a tryout. These players are automatically reassigned to the same team in Major A.) As players are selected for Major A, all players of league age 11 or 12 are considered. In general, a 12 year old player is selected ahead of an 11 year old of similar ability; however, a 12 year old is not assigned to Major A based on age alone if the player is likely to be overwhelmed by the higher level of competition. BYB's goal is to place each player at the level where he/she has the best chance for a successful season and a positive baseball experience. Teams are assembled by the Major A League VP, who consults the Major B League VP and Major A coaches. The objective is to construct teams that are comparable in talent so that the competition among them is as balanced as possible. Major A League umpires are adults who are certified and assigned by a professional umpire service, or experienced former BYB players of high school age who have been trained in umpiring. One or two umpires may be assigned for a game. If no assigned umpire arrives by the time the game is scheduled to begin, the two head coaches may, upon mutual agreement, select one or two of those in attendance (including themselves) to umpire the game. Before each game, head coaches must meet with the umpires at home plate to review ground rules and other rules that are unique to BYB's Major A League. During a game, only a head coach may discuss a play with an umpire. The head coach of the home team is responsible for paying the umpire. Bats and Baseballs Only wooden bats are allowed in this league; aluminum bats are not permitted. Wooden bats used in a game must be between 27 and 32 inches in length and no more than 32 ounces in weight. Regulation hard balls are used in all practices and games. Any questions or concerns regarding the Major A League should be directed to the league VP. Questions or concerns about umpiring should be directed to the VP in charge of umpires. See the BYB website (www.brooklineyouthbaseball.org) for a list of VPs and their email addresses. The Major A League uses the official Little League Baseball playing rules as a standard guide, amended by the following game rules. BYB's principal goal is to ensure an atmosphere of sportsmanship and civility. Other objectives, such as winning and personal performance, are secondary. The following Code of Conduct, which is based on these priorities, applies to all BYB games and practices. All players, coaches, and spectators must: Treat other players, coaches, spectators, and umpires with respect. Refrain from: criticizing, insulting, taunting, blaming, or threatening another person; using foul language; and physically abusing another person. Accept the decisions of umpires without complaint. (A head coach may question the application of a rule, but judgment calls may not be argued.) Treat all equipment with care Players must play by the rules of the game and accept coaches' decisions without complaint. Head coaches must monitor the behavior of their players, assistant coaches, and spectators, and must act immediately to put a stop to unsportsmanlike behavior when it occurs. All coaches must follow the rules, treat each player as an individual, recognize and reward effort as well as talent, and promote sportsmanship. Spectators are encouraged to cheer and show appreciation for good plays and efforts made by both teams, and may not challenge or criticize a coach's decision. In the event that a player, coach, or spectator violates BYB's Code of Conduct, both the umpire and the league VP are authorized to dismiss the individual from the field, and to stop the game and declare a forfeit if the individual does not comply. In addition, BYB reserves the right to impose further sanctions, including expulsion from the BYB program (without a refund of registration fees to players or their families). Game Format Major A League games are designed to allow players to apply the skills they've learned during practices. These games are competitive, and scores are recorded. All games are scheduled to last six innings. In the event of inclement weather during the day of a game, head coaches are responsible for contacting each other to determine whether the game can be played. Head coaches are also responsible for calling the Town of Brookline's Recreation Information Line (730 2083 or 730 2084) to find out if the fields are closed because of poor conditions; the recorded message on this line is typically updated by 11:00 a.m. on weekdays and 7:00 a.m. on weekends. Before a game, the head coaches have the authority to decide whether the game can be played (if the fields are open); if the head coaches cannot reach an agreement, the head coach of the home team has final say. Once a game has begun, the umpire has the authority to stop the game due to inclement weather or poor field conditions, after consulting both head coaches. (Note: The most important consideration must be the safety of the players.) Postponements If the two head coaches are unable to reach each other directly, only the home team's head coach may postpone a game on his/her own. In this situation, he/she must immediately leave a voice message notifying both the visiting team's head coach and the league VP of the postponement, or risk losing the game by forfeit. If a game is postponed before the teams have arrived at the field, the home team's head coach must notify the league VP of the postponement as soon as possible so that the league VP has time to notify the coordinator of umpires. (Ideally, the league VP should be notified three hours before the scheduled start time, but this isn't always possible because of sudden changes in the weather.) If the umpire arrives at the field because BYB provided late notice or no notice of a postponement, the home team coach must pay the umpire the full amount. Rescheduling A postponed game must be rescheduled at a later date, time, and location agreed upon by the two head coaches and the league VP. The league VP is responsible for providing an umpire at the rescheduled game. The home team is required to provide bases for each game. Both teams must provide their own bats and batting helmets, although each team must share batting helmets if the other team doesn't have enough. Each team is required to provide two new game balls to the umpire before the start of the game. Before the game, head coaches must meet with the umpire at home plate to review ground rules and other rules that are unique to BYB's Major A League. Coaches and Spectators Coaches are allowed to choose two assistant coaches and a scorekeeper to be in the bench area during games. Only head coaches and assistant coaches are allowed on the field during a break in play to instruct players. Only head coaches, assistant coaches, and players are allowed to coach from the first and third base coaching boxes (players must wear helmets). Only a head coach is allowed to discuss a play with an umpire. Spectators who are not coaches must watch the game in the areas designated for spectators, and are not allowed on the field or in the bench area with the team. No spectator may stand behind the backstop during a game. Fielding a Team A team must be able to field at least eight players to play a game. If a team cannot field at least eight players when the game is scheduled to begin, the start of the game may be delayed for 10 minutes in order to allow late players to arrive. If, after 10 minutes, the team still cannot field at least eight players, that team must forfeit the game. If an injury or early departure leaves a team unable to field at least eight players at any time after a game has begun, that team must forfeit the game. (Note: A shorthanded team may not borrow players from the opposing team.) If a coach knows ahead of time that he/she will not be able to field at least nine players for a game and would like to borrow a player from the Major B League, the coach must first contact the Major A League VP, who will request a player from the Major B League VP. Only a player who does not have a Major B game on the same day is allowed to play in a Major A game. (Note: Major B players may not pitch in a Major A game and must bat at the bottom of the batting order.) During each game, each player must play in the field for at least four innings, except when: The game is stopped prior to six innings of play because of inclement weather, poor field conditions, or darkness. The coach benches a player for disciplinary reasons such as missing games and/or practices without notifying the coach, insubordination, or disruptive behavior. The coach must notify the opposing coach of the disciplinary action before the start of the game. (Note: Poor play is not a valid reason for benching a player.) Each player must sit on the bench for at least one inning per game, except when: Not enough players are available. Each time a coach doesn't have enough players available to comply with the must sit requirement, he/she must allow a different player to play a complete game. No player, except a catcher (see the next bullet), may play two complete games until each player on the team has played one complete game. An injury to or absence of a player leaves no back up catcher available. In this case, the coach may keep the same player at the catcher position for the entire game. The coach must inform the opposing coach of the injury or absence prior to the game or immediately when the injury occurs. (Note: Only an injury to or absence of all back up catchers permits one player to catch an entire game, and each team must have at least two catchers to help prevent this situation.) A pitcher may not pitch more than five innings in a game under any circumstances. Substitutions and Mound Visits As long as playing time requirements are met, players may be freely substituted throughout the game — except at pitcher. All fielding changes, except pitching changes and substitutions due to injury, must be made at the start of an inning. No fielding substitutions may be made in the middle of an inning unless it involves a pitcher switching places with another fielder. A ""mound visit"" occurs any time an umpire calls time out to allow a coach to speak with the pitcher, or to speak with a position player who then speaks with the pitcher before the next pitch. Coaches are allowed one free mound visit per inning to speak with each pitcher. A second mound visit to the same pitcher in the same inning requires the coach to replace the pitcher. (Note: If a coach replaces a pitcher during a mound visit and speaks with the new pitcher before leaving the mound, the visit does not count as a mound visit to the new pitcher.) A pitcher who is removed from the mound may not re enter the game as a pitcher, but may re enter the game at another position. Other infielders (but not outfielders) may huddle with the coach on the mound during mound visits. However, the umpire may direct the players back to their positions and the coach back to the bench if, in the umpire's opinion, the game is being delayed unnecessarily. The on deck batter may not hold a bat while waiting in the on deck area. All players who are not at bat or on deck must remain on the bench at all times, unless warming up to pitch. Pitchers must warm up away from the bench area: down the foul line, in foul territory, adjacent to the outfield nearest their bench. Spectators who are not coaches must watch the game in the areas designated for spectators, and are not allowed on the field or in the bench area with the team. No player, coach, or spectator may stand behind the backstop during a game. The following pitching rules are in force during the regular season, and in the playoffs unless adjusted by the league VP. If the league VP adjusts these rules for the playoffs, he/she will inform the league's head coaches before the playoffs begin. These restrictions are designed to protect pitchers' throwing arms from overuse. A team that violates a pitching rule is subject to disciplinary action, which may include forfeiture of the game in which the violation occurred and/or suspension of the coach. Innings Limit Maximum innings for each pitcher: Per game: 5 Per pitching week (Sunday Saturday): 6 Important notes about innings limits: Any inning in which a pitcher throws at least one pitch to a batter counts as a full inning for that pitcher. If a game is stopped before it has become an official game, the innings pitched still count toward each pitcher's total innings for the week. Rest Requirements The following rest requirements remain in force even when a new pitching week has begun (in other words, the start of a new pitching week does not eliminate the rest requirement). Note that players may not pitch on consecutive days. Innings Pitched in a Game Full Calendar Days of Rest Required Example 1 3 1 A player who pitches 4 innings on Friday may not pitch again until Tuesday. A player who pitches three innings on Sunday may not pitch again until Tuesday. A player who pitches four innings on Sunday may not pitch again until Thursday. Pitch Limits In addition to abiding by the mandatory innings limits and rest requirements, each head coach must record the number of pitches thrown by each pitcher on his/her team during each game, and must report each pitcher's pitch count to the league VP after the game. Coaches are expected to limit the number of pitches each pitcher throws according to the pitch maximums in the following table, and to verify ongoing pitch counts with the opposing coach after each half inning. BYB reserves the right to discipline any coach who allows a pitcher to exceed these limits. Pitches per Day Pitches per Week Before May 18 60 80 On or After May 18 80 100 Prohibited Pitches Any pitch that entails the snapping or turning of the wrist — such as a Curveball or Slider — is prohibited. When done incorrectly or too often, this type of delivery is likely to lead to forearm and elbow injuries. The intent of this rule is not to keep a player from throwing a pitch that changes direction, but to keep him/her from snapping or turning the wrist during the delivery of the pitch. Therefore, a pitch that changes direction but does not entail snapping or turning the wrist, such as a Two Seam Fastball or a Circle Change Up, is allowed. (Note: Head coaches are responsible for ensuring that the umpire is aware of this rule before the game begins.) If a pitcher snaps or turns the wrist during delivery, the umpire must issue a warning to the pitcher. If the batter swings at and misses the pitch or hits into an out, the pitch is called a ball and the batter continues his/her at bat; however, if the batter hits the ball and reaches base safely, he/she may remain on base. Upon a second violation of the rule by the same pitcher, the pitcher must be removed from the mound but may remain in the game at another position. Balks are not called. Intentional walks are allowed only if first base is open and there are less than two outs. A pitcher who hits two batters in an inning or three in a game must be removed from the mound. A pitcher who is removed from the mound may not re enter the game as a pitcher, but may remain in or re enter the game at another position. Each player at this position must wear a complete set of catcher's equipment: helmet, face mask, throat guard, chest protector, catcher's mitt, shin guards, and protective cup. If a catcher, when his/her team is batting, reaches base or is on base with two outs in an inning, the coach has the option to temporarily replace the catcher with a pinch runner so that the catcher can begin putting on the catcher's equipment. This rule is designed to allow the next half inning to begin without delay, and applies only if the catcher will return to the catcher position. The pinch runner must be the player who made the most recent out. Each batter must wear a helmet in the on deck area and throughout the at bat. Batting Order Each team must provide the opposing team's scorekeeper with a batting order before the game. With the exception of players who become injured or leave the field early, all players must remain in the same spot in the order throughout the game — even when not playing in the field. If a player must be removed from the order because of injury or early departure, the removal must be reported to the opposing scorekeeper and the player's spot in the order may be skipped for the rest of the game without an out being recorded. Players who arrive after the game has begun must be added to the end of the order and reported to the opposing scorekeeper immediately. When a player fails to bat in his/her proper spot in the order: If the mistake is detected and pointed out by either head coach before the at bat is completed, the improper batter is replaced by the proper batter, who inherits any balls and strikes that had already been called. If the head coach of the fielding team appeals to the umpire after the improper batter has concluded the at bat but before the first pitch to the next batter, the proper batter (the one who failed to bat in turn) is called out. In this case, the improper batter may not remain on base, any advances by base runners that resulted from a ball hit into play by the improper batter are nullified, and the batting order resumes with the batter who would normally bat after the proper batter, even if it's the same batter who just batted improperly. If the head coach of the fielding team appeals after the first pitch to the next batter, the improper batter remains on base, no batter is called out, base runner advances are not nullified, and the batting order resumes with the batter who would normally bat after the improper batter. BUNTS/SACRIFICE FLIES/DROPPED THIRD STRIKES Bunting is allowed; a bunt into foul territory after the batter already has two strikes is a strike out. Sacrifice fly balls, in which a base runner tags up and advances to the next base after the ball is caught, are allowed. A batter may not advance to first base on a wild pitch or passed ball on a third strike. Infield Fly/Hidden Ball The Infield Fly Rule is enforced in this league, and applies only when all of the following conditions are met: An infield pop up is in fair territory and, in the umpire's opinion, can be caught by an infielder with ordinary effort. There are base runners on first and second bases or the bases are loaded. There are less than two outs. When calling the Infield Fly Rule, the umpire calls the batter out whether or not the ball is caught, and the base runners may tag up/advance at their own risk. BYB does not allow hidden ball plays designed to deceive base runners at any level of play. Base Runners Each base runner must wear a helmet until he/she returns to the bench. Leading and Stealing Leading is not allowed in this league. A player who takes a lead must receive a warning on the first offense and be called out on the second offense. Stealing is allowed, but the base runner may not leave the base until the ball crosses home plate. If a base runner leaves a base early and steals successfully, the base runner must return to the base where he/she started; however, if a base runner leaves a base early and is thrown out trying to steal, the base runner is out. Base runners may not advance if the pitcher is standing on any part of the mound with the ball. A base runner may not intentionally make contact with a fielder. A base runner who, in the umpire's opinion, initiates contact with a fielder anywhere on the base paths may be called out. To prevent collisions, a base runner approaching second base, third base, or home plate must slide feet first if a throw is made in an attempt to get the base runner out — even if the throw is late or off target. A base runner who does not slide may be called out by the umpire if the base runner makes contact with a fielder. A base runner who slides head first when advancing to a base may be called out by the umpire. Head first slides are permitted only when a base runner is diving back to a base to avoid being doubled off on a line drive or to avoid being picked off. (Note: A base runner may not slide when advancing to first base.) Plays at Home Plate Advancing on Overthrows If a fielder causes a ball to leave the playing field — beyond the backstop or the side boundaries (usually the team benches) agreed upon before the game — each base runner is awarded the base he/she is going to plus one additional base. When the ball is within the playing field, base runners advance at their own risk. Pinch Runners Mercy Rule An inning must end when the batting team scores 10 runs or the fielding team makes three outs, whichever occurs first. The 10 run rule, however, does not apply during the final inning of play. The inning is not over after a team bats around the order — only after 10 runs have been scored. If the score is tied after six innings, play continues until one team has more total runs than the other after the bottom half of an extra inning. If the score is still tied when darkness, weather, or the scheduled start of another game causes the game to be stopped: If it's a regular season game, the game is complete and considered a tie. If it's a playoff game, the game must be concluded at a later date, time, and location agreed upon by the two head coaches and the league VP. Prior to May 15, an inning may not be started after 7:30 p.m. After that date, an inning may not be started after 7:50 p.m. If, in the umpire's opinion, after consulting both head coaches, an inning is unlikely to be completed in daylight, the game must be stopped before the start of that inning. Under no circumstances may a game be continued when it's difficult for any player to see the ball. The umpire is authorized to stop a game because of darkness at any time. If a game is official and is stopped in the middle of an inning, the score reverts to what it was at the end of the last completed inning. Official Game A game is considered official after two and a half innings have been played when the home team is leading, or after three full innings otherwise. Partial Game If a game must be discontinued because of inclement weather, poor field conditions, or darkness before it becomes an official game, it must be resumed at a later date, time, and location agreed upon by the two head coaches and the league VP. Resumed Game A partial game that's resumed must continue from the exact point where it left off: the same half of the same inning, with the same batter, batting orders, base runners, pitchers, and fielders. Partial game players who are unavailable for the resumed game may be replaced by other available players who were not in the field or in the lineup when the partial game was stopped. However, a pitcher who had been removed from the partial game before it was stopped may not pitch in the resumed game. The league VP is responsible for providing an umpire at the resumed game. The winner and score of the game (the score of a forfeit is recorded as 6 0) The number of innings played The numbers of innings pitched by each pitcher for both teams Rule Violations, Disputes, and Protests A coach who notices that the opposing team is about to violate a rule (such as a playing time rule) must notify the opposing coach immediately. It is not acceptable to wait until the rule has been violated in an attempt to win by forfeit; this is not consistent with the spirit of youth baseball or the objectives of BYB If a rule violation has occurred: The head coach who observes the violation should first bring it to the attention of the opposing head coach and, if possible, resolve the issue without involving the umpire. If the issue cannot be resolved between the two head coaches, they must then consult the umpire. For certain violations, such as batting out of order or use of an illegal bat, the umpire must be notified immediately after the conclusion of the at bat in which the violation occurred, before the first pitch to the next batter (see BATTING ORDER for more details). After the umpire makes a decision to resolve the dispute, the coaches must abide by that decision and must resume play and complete the game. The umpire has final authority while the game is in progress, and his or her decision cannot be reversed during the course of the game without his or her consent. If a head coach disagrees with the umpire's decision and wants to elevate the issue to the league VP, he or she must: Formally protest the game before resuming play. To do this, the coach must write the word ""protest"" in his or her scorebook, record the game details at the time of the protest (inning, score, outs, base runners), and have the umpire sign the score book. Any other form of protest, such as refusing to resume play (except when the safety of the players is compromised), is not allowed and may result in a forfeit against the protesting team and further discipline against that team's head coach. Contact the league VP within two hours after the conclusion of the game to complete the protest. The league VP will then take whatever steps are necessary to resolve the dispute fairly, and will make a decision that may include allowing the final score to stand, replaying some or all of the game, or awarding a forfeit to overturn the outcome of the game. Note: A coach may not protest a game after the conclusion of the game without following the protest process described above. Therefore, any rule violation or dispute that is not brought to the attention of the opposing head coach and the umpire while the game is in progress cannot be used as grounds for a protest after the game has ended. Standings are determined using each team's Total Points (win = two points; tie = one point). The top two seeds at the end of the regular season receive a bye in the first round of the playoffs. If two teams are tied, the following tie breakers are applied in the order shown: Winning Percentage (ties are ignored in calculating winning percentage) Win/Loss Record: head to head Runs Scored minus Runs Allowed: head to head Win/Loss Record: versus the next best seed Runs Scored minus Runs Allowed: versus the next best seed",0.94881225

In a chamber overlooking the nighttime waterways of a maritime city, a man looks back on his youth and the people who shaped his life. Danio Cerra's intelligence won him entry to a renowned school even though he was only the son of a tailor. He took service at the court of a ruling count and soon learned why that man was known as the Beast. Danio's fate changed the moment he saw and recognized Adria Ripoli as she entered the count's chambers one autumn night intending to kill. Born to power, Adria had chosen, instead of a life of comfort, one of danger and freedom. Which is how she encounters Danio in a perilous time and place. Vivid figures share the unfolding story. Among them: a healer determined to defy her expected lot; a charming, frivolous son of immense wealth; a powerful religious leader more decadent than devout; and, affecting all these lives and many more, two larger than life mercenary commanders, lifelong adversaries, whose rivalry puts a world in the balance. A Brightness Long Ago offers both compelling drama and deeply moving reflections on the nature of memory, the choices we make in life, and the role played by the turning of Fortune's wheel.","A Brightness Long Ago Guy Gavriel Kay International bestselling author Guy Gavriel Kay's latest work is set in a world evoking early Renaissance Italy and offers an extraordinary cast of characters whose lives come together through destiny, love, and ambition. In a chamber overlooking the nighttime waterways of a maritime city, a man looks back on his youth and the people who shaped his life. Danio Cerra's intelligence won him entry to a renowned school even though he was only the son of a tailor. He took service at the court of a ruling count—and soon learned why that man was known as the Beast. Danio's fate changed the moment he saw and recognized Adria Ripoli as she entered the count's chambers one autumn night—intending to kill. Born to power, Adria had chosen, instead of a life of comfort, one of danger—and freedom. Which is how she encounters Danio in a perilous time and place. Vivid figures share the unfolding story. Among them: a healer determined to defy her expected lot; a charming, frivolous son of immense wealth; a powerful religious leader more decadent than devout; and, affecting all these lives and many more, two larger than life mercenary commanders, lifelong adversaries, whose rivalry puts a world in the balance.

Markey (D Mass.), Chairman and Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on East Asia, the Pacific, and International Cybersecurity, introduced comprehensive bipartisan legislation to economically and diplomatically pressure North Korea and its enablers, and authorize efforts to combat Pyongyang's widespread human rights and labor trafficking abuses, to support and enhance efforts to find a diplomatic solution to the threat of North Korea's accelerating development of nuclear weapons and the missiles that deliver them. The legislation titled, the Leverage to Enhance Effective Diplomacy Act of 2017, expands on sanctions legislation introduced earlier this year by Gardner and Markey. ""There is no military solution to the threat of a nuclear North Korea,"" said Markey. ""While the effort to economically and politically isolate North Korea will be essential for a diplomatic strategy to succeed, we must also recognize that pressure, without diplomatic engagement, will quickly become counterproductive. Our diplomatic strategy must combine economic pressure with talks to convince Kim Jong un that the United States is not the threat he believes us to be and that he does not require nuclear weapons to survive.""

The long lost recordings were captured by a mobile studio that now resides at Studio Bell in Calgary as part of Canada's National Music Centre. Before calling Canada home, the studio was owned by the Rolling Stones, who had the mobile facility constructed in 1968 and recorded multiple acts over the years, including Marley. It was later acquired by the National Music Centre in 2001, and following a restoration project, it continues to record artists today. ""This truck was available for hire,"" Jason Tawkin, manager of building audio at Studio Bell, told CTV. ""It was owned by the Rolling Stones but it was also a side business for them. They had invested a significant amount of money into it and they wanted a return on that investment."" The Marley tapes in question were captured live in London and Paris in the '70s, but they were thought to be lost over the years. Recently, though, the 2 inch reel to reel 24 track analogue tapes were saved from a London dump and digitally restored. Now, they are set to go on auction later this month. Among the recovered reels are recordings of Bob Marley and the Wailers in London at the Lyceum in 1975, the Hammersmith Odeon in 1976 and the Rainbow in 1977, in addition to a concert at France's Pavilion de Paris in 1978. As Tawkin explained, Marley was among many who used the Stones' mobile studio. ""There's lots of stories in the industry of tapes being lost,"" he said. ""I know of one story where Jimi Hendrix left one of the master tapes in a cab in New York City. Where that tape is now? No one knows. These things just fall off the back of the truck, if you will, and the cool thing about tape is that when you do recover it, there's usually a way to recover the content that's within those tapes because of the technology.""

Blunt will play the titular character in the upcoming Mary Poppins Returns; following in the footsteps of veteran actress Julie Andrews who catapulted to fame after winning the Best Actress Awards in the Oscars, BAFTA, and Golden Globes for playing the beloved nanny character. Meanwhile, Miranda, the Pulitzer Prize winner and creator of the hit Broadway musical Hamilton, will be playing a new character named Jack, who, in the sequel, is a streetlamp lighter. The original movie was based on a book by P.L. Travers, about a magical nanny with a flying umbrella who helps improves the lives of the Banks family; particularly brother and sister Michael and Jane. Mary Poppins Returns picks up from where the original left off; set in Depression era London. In the sequel, Mary Poppins meets up with the now grown up Jane Banks, Michael Banks, and his three children after they suffer a personal loss. ""Through her unique magical skills, and with the aid of her friend Jack, she helps the family rediscover the joy and wonder missing in their lives,"" Walt Disney Co. studio told Reuters. It is not clear if original cast members Andrews, now 80 years old, or Dick Van Dyke, the 90 year old actor who played the original sidekick to Mary Poppins, will return in the sequel in any capacity. The new Mary Poppins movie will be directed by Rob Marshall, who worked in another Disney hit, Into the Woods while Finding Neverland writer, David Magee, will work on the screenplay. Award winning musical team Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman will be composing new original songs and scoring for the upcoming sequel.

The studio has announced that Mary Poppins Returns, the sequel to its 1964 classic Mary Poppins, will arrive December 25, 2018. As previously reported, Emily Blunt takes over the role of the practically perfect British nanny, while Hamilton superstar Lin Manuel Miranda stars as a new character named Jack. Along with that release date comes many new details about the story, so keep reading for all the latest on Mary Poppins Returns. Disney announced the Mary Poppins Returns release date via press release today. The film's only direct competition so far for that date is an untitled Warner Bros. event film, though Sony also has its animated Spider Man movie opening a few days earlier on December 21. Here's how Disney describes the story of Mary Poppins Returns: Blunt has been cast as Mary Poppins and Miranda will play a new character, a street lamplighter named Jack. Drawing from the wealth of material in P.L. Travers' seven additional novels, the story will take place in Depression era London (when the books were originally written) and follows a now grown Jane and Michael Banks, who, along with Michael's three children, are visited by the enigmatic Mary Poppins following a personal loss. Through her unique magical skills, and with the aid of her friend Jack, she helps the family rediscover the joy and wonder missing in their lives. Rob Marshall, who directed Blunt in Into the Woods, will return to helm Mary Poppins Returns, from a screenplay by David Magee (Life of Pi, Finding Neverland). Marc Shaiman is composing an all new score, and writing original songs with Scott Wittman. I can't say I've exactly been clamoring for a sequel to Mary Poppins, but only a fool would bet against Disney's live action fairy tale franchise at this point. Sure, Alice Through the Looking Glass was a disappointment, but Maleficent, Cinderella, and The Jungle Book have all been outsized hits. Plus, the involvement of Blunt and Miranda, two of the internet's favorite stars, should help win over some skeptics. The world probably doesn't need a Mary Poppins sequel, but I'll probably be curious enough to check it out anyway when the time comes. Lin Manuel Miranda's 'Tick, Tick… Boom!'

Ludovic Marin/Pool via AP/File photo French ex President Nicolas Sarkozy, who was convicted Thursday and sentenced to a year of house arrest for illegal campaign financing of his unsuccessful 2012 reelection bid, will appeal the ruling, his lawyer said. The court said Sarkozy would be allowed to serve the one year sentence at home by wearing an electronic monitoring bracelet. Sarkozy's lawyer, Thierry Herzog, noted that the sentence corresponds to the maximum his client faced. He said he had spoken with Sarkozy, who had asked him to appeal. ""The verdict won't be enforceable"" pending appeal, he added. Sarkozy, France's president from 2007 to 2012, had vigorously denied wrongdoing during the trial in May and June. Sarkozy wasn't present at the Paris court for the ruling. He is accused of having spent almost twice the maximum legal amount of 22.5 million euros ($27.5 million) on the reelection bid that he lost to Socialist Francois Hollande. The court stated that Sarkozy ""knew"" the legal limit was at stake and ""voluntarily"" failed to supervise additional expenses. Thursday's verdict comes after Sarkozy, 66, was found guilty on March 1 of corruption and influence peddling in another case. He was given a year in prison, and two years suspended, in that case but is free pending appeal. It is the first time in France's modern history that a former president has been convicted and sentenced to a prison term for actions during his term. Sarkozy's predecessor, Jacques Chirac, was found guilty in 2011 of misuse of public money during his time as Paris mayor and was given a two year suspended prison sentence. In the campaign financing case, prosecutors concluded that Sarkozy knew weeks before the 2012 election that his expenses — which are strictly limited under French law — were getting close to the legal maximum. They accused him of having ignored two notes from his accountants warning about the money issue. The court on Thursday said despite being aware of the risk of exceeding the limit, he chose to organize many rallies, including giant ones. ""These rallies have been approved by Nicolas Sarkozy and he took advantage of them,"" the court said. During the trial, Sarkozy told the court the extra money didn't go into his campaign, but instead helped make other people richer. He denied any ""fraudulent intent."" He also insisted he didn't handle the day to day organization because he had a team to do that and therefore couldn't be blamed for the amount of spending. In addition to the former president, 13 other people went on trial, including members of his conservative Republicans party, accountants and heads of the communication group in charge of organizing the rallies, Bygmalion. They have all been found guilty, with sentences going from a suspended prison sentence to two years of house arrest with an electronic bracelet. Various charges include forgery, fraud and complicity in illegal campaign financing. Some have acknowledged wrongdoing and detailed the system of false invoices that aimed to cover up the overspending. Sarkozy retired from active politics in 2017, but is still playing a role behind the scenes. French media have reported that he is involved in the process of choosing a conservative candidate ahead of France's presidential election next year.

Photo: Christophe Archambault/AFP A French court on Thursday handed former president Nicolas Sarkozy a one year sentence for illegal financing of his 2012 re election bid, dealing a fresh blow to the right winger six months after a conviction for corruption. Sarkozy will not serve time behind bars under the terms of this verdict, however, with the court ruling that he would be able to serve the sentence outside of prison. He was not in court to hear the judge hand down the maximum sentence for illegal campaign financing after finding that he had ""voluntarily neglected"" to monitor his campaign spending. Sarkozy's lawyer Thierry Herzog said he would appeal the verdict. The verdict which means he will likely serve the term at home with an ankle bracelet if confirmed on appeal is not the same as a suspended sentence and goes down in his record as a full prison term. The 66 year old remains a hugely popular and influential figure on the right despite being caught up in multiple investigations since being voted out of the Elysée Palace after a single term in 2012. In March, he became France's first post war president to be handed a custodial sentence when he was given a three year term, two years of which were suspended, for corruption and influence peddling over attempts to secure favours from a judge. Sarkozy promptly appealed his verdict, and under French sentencing guidelines he has not yet been put behind bars judges said he could wear an electronic ankle bracelet. Three months later he was back in the dock over his lavish 2012 re election campaign. Illegal campaign financing carries a maximum sentence of a year in prison and a fine of €3,750 euros. Prosecutors had asked the court to give Sarkozy a one year term, but to suspend six months of the sentence. Thirteen other people, including Sarkozy's former campaign manager, several Bygmalion executives and a handful of former directors of Sarkozy's The Republicans party were also tried in the case. They received jail terms of up to three and a half years in prison, with part of the sentences suspended. Before Sarkozy, the only French leader to be sentenced at trial was his predecessor Jacques Chirac, who received a two year suspended sentence in 2011 for corruption over a fake jobs scandal relating to his time as Paris mayor. Sarkozy attended just one day of his five week trial for questioning, a snub that infuriated prosecutors who accused him of acting ""as if he is not answerable to the law like everyone else."" The prosecution says accountants had warned Sarkozy that he was set to blow past the official €22.5 million spending cap but that he insisted on holding more events to fend off his ultimately victorious Socialist rival Francois Hollande. In the end, his campaign spending came to at least €42.8 million, nearly double the legal limit. Sarkozy told the court that he had been too busy running the country to pay attention to an ""accounting detail"" and that the allegations he was reckless with public money were ""a fairytale"". The case is known as the Bygmalion affair, after the name of the public relations firm hired to orchestrate a blitz of lavish US style election rallies. Bygmalion executives have admitted to using a system of fake invoices to mask the real cost of the events. The investigation failed to prove however that Sarkozy had any direct hand in the fraud. The case failed to garner much interest among the public, with the charges seen as less sensational than the corruption charges that had already dented any prospect of Sarkozy making another comeback. In 2016, he attempted to win back the Elysée Palace but failed to win the presidential nomination for the UMP party, since renamed Les Républicains (LR). Despite his political setbacks and legal woes Sarkozy still enjoys considerable sway in French politics, with conservative candidates in next year's presidential election vying for his endorsement.

Harding While skillfully written and engaging, the new HBO series Boardwalk Empire creates a highly flawed view of our 29th President, Warren G. Harding, and his alleged relationship with Nan Britton. The caricature of Harding continues a long series of smears that date back to the 1920s. Harding's relationship with Nan Britton is questionable. His relationship with a woman named Carrie Phillips is not. My book, The Harding Affair, discloses Harding's complex relationship with Mrs. Phillips through the use of over 900 pages of letters Harding wrote to Phillips from 1910 though 1920, when he was elected President of the United States. Phillips and Harding were caught in an age when divorce was unthinkable and there were multifaceted reasons for their long term (15 year) affair. The affair was much too complicated to caulk it up sheer womanizing. The Britton allegations are subject to real doubt, as I point out in my book. Ms. Britton lived directly behind Carrie Phillips's home in Marion, and there is good reason to believe her book, The President's Daughter, came from her familiarity with the Harding/Phillips correspondence and not because of any real relationship between then Senator Harding and Ms. Britton. The HBO series relies on biographies that falsely used the Phillips correspondence. Worse, letters Mr. Harding wrote to Mrs. Phillips are used to manufacture dialogue for Ms. Britton's character. But sadly for history, these smears of President Harding distort what he did as President and as a U. S. Senator. Harding was no ""imbecile,"" as Nucky Thompson, the main character in the HBO series, calls him. As a Senator, Harding courageously stood against Woodrow Wilson's call for America to go to war to ""make the world safe for democracy,"" though he did vote for war. In a lesson America never learned, Harding warned that it is not the business of the United States to engage in regime change through the violence of war. During his presidency, Harding pardoned Socialist Eugene Debs, who was rotting in an Atlanta prison, sent there by the Wilson Administration for violating the Espionage and Sedition Act. Debs' crime? He spoke out against the war—that is, he exercised his right of free speech. Wilson denied a pardon even after the war ended. Harding granted it. Who is the ""imbecile""?

It has likewise become a preferred term on the planet of sex and sexuality. Understood for its fetishes and unusual acts of sexual intercourse, hentai works have actually ended up being more popular than sushi and geisha. The term hentai is in fact a mistranslation of the Japanese term hentai seiyoku, which means ' graphic sexual intercourse '. It was originally used to explain an erotica called The Dream of the Fisherman 's Wife. During the 19th century, shunga erotica was suppressed by shoguns. This implied that the production of such works had to stop. The interest in erotics continued to grow in Japan, particularly throughout the Showa duration. By the end of the 1950s, stories about male homosexuality and cross dressing were the significant preoccupations in magazines.

It is not uncommon for westerners to associate hentai with adult anime, nevertheless the Japanese meaning of the word is much more diverse. In Japan, hentai is often used in colloquial speech to describe uncommon kinks. The Japanese term ecchi is a variation of the word hentai. Originally, ecchi indicated "" h "" in "" other half "". It was used for this function from 1868 to 1912, and it was the first Japanese slang to bring a specific sexual recommendation. Throughout the mid 1950s, it came into wider use in colloquial speech, and it was ultimately reduced to hentai. The first known sexual representations of hentai remained in Wonderkid 's Lolita Anime.

Harding Posted on November 30, 2010 May 15, 2016 by Ken Ackerman While skillfully written and engaging, the new HBO series Boardwalk Empire creates a highly flawed view of our 29th President, Warren G. Harding, and his alleged relationship with Nan Britton. The caricature of Harding continues a long series of smears that date back to the 1920s. Harding's relationship with Nan Britton is questionable. His relationship with a woman named Carrie Phillips is not. My book, The Harding Affair, discloses Harding's complex relationship with Mrs. Phillips through the use of over 900 pages of letters Harding wrote to Phillips from 1910 though 1920, when he was elected President of the United States. Phillips and Harding were caught in an age when divorce was unthinkable and there were multifaceted reasons for their long term (15 year) affair. The affair was much too complicated to caulk it up sheer womanizing. The Britton allegations are subject to real doubt, as I point out in my book. Ms. Britton lived directly behind Carrie Phillips's home in Marion, and there is good reason to believe her book, The President's Daughter, came from her familiarity with the Harding/Phillips correspondence and not because of any real relationship between then Senator Harding and Ms. Britton. The HBO series relies on biographies that falsely used the Phillips correspondence. Worse, letters Mr. Harding wrote to Mrs. Phillips are used to manufacture dialogue for Ms. Britton's character. But sadly for history, these smears of President Harding distort what he did as President and as a U. S. Senator. Harding was no ""imbecile,"" as Nucky Thompson, the main character in the HBO series, calls him. As a Senator, Harding courageously stood against Woodrow Wilson's call for America to go to war to ""make the world safe for democracy,"" though he did vote for war. In a lesson America never learned, Harding warned that it is not the business of the United States to engage in regime change through the violence of war. During his presidency, Harding pardoned Socialist Eugene Debs, who was rotting in an Atlanta prison, sent there by the Wilson Administration for violating the Espionage and Sedition Act. Debs' crime? He spoke out against the war—that is, he exercised his right of free speech. Wilson denied a pardon even after the war ended. Harding granted it. Who is the ""imbecile""? Entertainment is entertainment. But playing fast and loose with serious historical figures only diminishes our true understanding of history's lessons. For a more, see http://thehardingaffair.com/.

Q: What is Acupuncture? A: Acupuncture is one of the oldest, most commonly used systems of healing in the world. It originated in China over 3,500 years ago and only in the last three decades has it become popular in the United States. In 1993, the Food and Drug Administration estimated that Americans made up to 12 million visits per year to acupuncture practitioners and spent upwards of half a billion dollars on acupuncture treatments. Traditional Oriental medicine teaches that there are over 2,000 acupuncture points on the human body, which are connected by 20 pathways (12 main, 8 secondary), called meridians. These meridians conduct energy, or qi, between the surface of the body and its internal organs. Each point has a different effect on the qi that passes through it. Qi is believed to help regulate balance in the body. It is influenced by the opposing forces of yin and yang, which represent positive and negative energy, as well as forces in the universe and human body. Acupuncture is believed to keep the balance between yin and yang, thus allowing for the normal flow of qi throughout the body and restoring health to the mind and body. Q: How Does it Work? A: Several theories have been presented as to how acupuncture works. One theory suggests that pain impulses are blocked from reaching the spinal cord or brain at various ""gates"". Since a majority of acupuncture points are either connected to (or are located near) neural structures, this suggests that acupuncture stimulates the nervous system. Another theory suggests that acupuncture stimulates the body to produce narcotic like substances, endorphins, which reduce pain. Other studies have found that other pain relieving substances, opiods, may be released into the body during acupuncture treatment. The general theory of acupuncture is that proper physiological function and health depends on the circulation of nutrients, substances, and energy, called qi, through a network of ""channels"" or ""meridians."" This network connects every organ and part of the body, providing balance, regulation and coordination of physiological processes. Pain and ill health result when the flow of qi through the body is disrupted or blocked by pathogens, trauma, injuries or medications, as well as lifestyle factors such as overwork, poor diet, disturbed emotions, lack of rest or stress. Click here to learn more about acupuncture. Q: Is it Safe? A: When practiced by a licensed, trained acupuncturist, acupuncture is extremely safe. As a system of health care, acupuncture already has some inherent safeguards. Because the treatment is drug free, patients do not have to worry about taking several doses of a medication or suffering a possible adverse reaction. Properly administered, acupuncture is a safe treatment. Please notify your acupuncturist before treatment if you have a pacemaker, as acupuncture can be performed, but electrical stimulation should not be used. It is also important to notify your acupuncturist if you have a tendency to bleed or bruise easily, if you are a hemophiliac, or if you have any other serious health conditions. Q: Many People Think Acupuncture is Painful… A: Unlike other needles, acupuncture needles are solid and hair thin, and they are not designed to cut the skin. They are inserted to much more shallow levels than hypodermic needles (needles used to give a shot or draw blood), generally no more than a half inch to an inch, depending on the type of treatment being delivered. While each person experiences acupuncture differently, most people feel only a minimal amount of discomfort as the needles pass through the most superficial layers of the skin. Some people report feeling a sensation of excitement, while others feel relaxed. Q: Diagnostic Methods… A: We use Oriental diagnostic methods utilizing the qi and the blood. Qi is yang and blood is yin. Qi is the life force that is believed to flow along a network of meridians in a person's body and is vital to their physical and spiritual health. If you have balanced qi and blood in the body, you do not get diseases. Unfortunately, no one is in perfect balance. With Oriental medicine, we try to balance the qi and blood of the patient in order to achieve homeostasis in the body. Q: What Kind of Diseases can Acupuncture Help? A: In the late 1970s, the World Health Organization recognized the ability of acupuncture and Oriental medicine to treat nearly four dozen common ailments, including neuro musculoskeletal conditions (such as arthritis, neuralgia, insomnia, dizziness, and neck/shoulder pain); emotional and psychological disorders (such as depression and anxiety); circulatory disorders (such as hypertension, angina pectoris, arteriosclerosis and anemia); addictions to alcohol, nicotine and other drugs; respiratory disorders (such as emphysema, sinusitis, allergies and bronchitis); and gastrointestinal conditions (such as food allergies, ulcers, chronic diarrhea, constipation, indigestion, intestinal weakness, anorexia and gastritis). In 1997, a consensus statement released by the National Institutes of Health found that acupuncture could be useful by itself or in combination with other therapies to treat addictions, headaches, menstrual cramps, tennis elbow, fibromyalgia, myofascial pain, osteoarthritis, lower back pain, carpal tunnel syndrome and asthma. Other studies have demonstrated that acupuncture may help in the rehabilitation of stroke patients and can relieve nausea in patients recovering from surgery. As the use of acupuncture increases, more research is being to study the mechanisms and effectiveness of acupuncture on hundreds of different diseases. Q: What is Herbal Medicine? A: Oriental medicine uses natural herbs like plants, roots, and leaves, as well as minerals. There are several types of herbal medicine: Decoction (liquid type), powder, pills or tablets. Decoction involves making a tea out of raw herbs and is the most effective. The others are less labor intensive, but slower to create change in the body. If you get both acupuncture and herbal treatments, you can expect much better results. That's why we strongly recommend herbal medicines to our patients.

A: As with most health practitioners, the first visit to an acupuncturist usually begins with the practitioner taking a detailed history. Since traditional Oriental medicine takes a more holistic approach to patient care than Western medicine, you may be asked questions that appear unimportant (questions about your sleep habits, your ability to tolerate heat or cold, your dietary habits, etc.), but are vital to the type of care you will receive. After reviewing your history, the practitioner will begin diagnosing your ailment. Depending on your condition, you may be subjected to an examination of the tongue, as well as an examination of the pulse,­ a major diagnostic technique in traditional Chinese medicine. Using all of the information obtained during the history and diagnosis, the practitioner will then determine the cause of your symptoms. Depending on the condition, needles will be inserted into specific acupuncture points on the body. The acupuncturist may use moxa or electrical stimulation to enhance acupuncture's therapeutic effect. Depending on the seriousness and the length of your condition, your first visit may take 1 2 hours. It may take several visits to see significant improvement or to cure your condition. As with any treatment plan, make sure that your questions are answered completely, and that the treatment plans seems reasonable. If you don't understand a particular technique or type of treatment, please ask for clarification. Q: How Long Does it Take? A: Usually it takes an hour to two hours for the first visit; after that, it usually takes about an hour. After needling, many patients feel calm and relaxed and fall asleep during the treatment. Q: Do You Accept Insurance? A: Yes. We accept most insurance plans and we are in the ASH (American Specialty Health) network. Please call our clinic and we will be happy to check if your insurance provides acupuncture benefits. Please contact us anytime. We would love to hear from you!

Originating in China some 3,500 years ago, only in the last three decades has it become popular in the United States. In 1993, the Food and Drug Administration estimated that Americans made up to 12 million visits per year to acupuncture practitioners and spent upwards of half a billion dollars on acupuncture treatments. Traditional Chinese medicine hold that there are as many as 2,000 acupuncture points on the human body, which are connected by 20 pathways (12 main, 8 secondary) called meridians. These meridians conduct energy, or qi (pronounced ""chi""), between the surface of the body and its internal organs. Each point has a different effect on the qi that passes through it. Qi is believed to help regulate balance in the body. It is influenced by the opposing forces of yin and yang, which represent positive and negative energy and forces in the universe and human body. Acupuncture is believed to keep the balance between yin and yang, thus allowing for the normal flow of qi throughout the body and restoring health to the mind and body. Several theories have been presented as to exactly how acupuncture works. One theory suggests that pain impulses are blocked from reaching the spinal cord or brain at various ""gates"" to these areas. Since a majority of acupuncture points are either connected to (or are located near) neural structures, this suggests that acupuncture stimulates the nervous system. Another theory suggests that acupuncture stimulates the body to produce narcotic like substances called endorphins, which reduce pain. Other studies have found that other pain relieving substances called opiods may be released into the body during acupuncture treatment. Does it hurt? Unlike hypodermic needles, acupuncture needles are solid and hair thin, and they are not designed to cut the skin. They are also inserted to much more shallow levels than hypodermic needles, generally no more than a half inch to an inch depending on the type of treatment being delivered. While each person experiences acupuncture differently, most people feel only a minimal amount of pain as the needles are inserted. Some people reportedly feel a sensation of excitement, while others feel relaxed. If you experience significant pain from the needles, it may be a sign that the procedure is being done improperly. When practiced by a licensed, trained acupuncturist, acupuncture is extremely safe. As a system of health care, acupuncture already has some inherent safeguards. Because the treatment is drug free, patients do not have to worry about taking several doses of a medication or suffering a possible adverse reaction. Properly administered, acupuncture does no harm. However, there are certain conditions you should notify an acupuncturist about before undergoing treatment. If you have a pacemaker, for instance, you should not receive electroacupuncture due to the possibility of electromagnetic interference with the pacemaker. Similarly, if you have a tendency to bleed or bruise easily, or if you are a hemophiliac, you may want to consider a different type of care. What conditions does it treat? In the late 1970s, the World Health Organization recognized the ability of acupuncture and Oriental medicine to treat nearly four dozen common ailments, including neuromusculoskeletal conditions (such as arthritis, neuralgia, insomnia, dizziness, and neck/shoulder pain); emotional and psychological disorders (such as depression and anxiety); circulatory disorders (such as hypertension, angina pectoris, arteriosclerosis and anemia); addictions to alcohol, nicotine and other drugs; respiratory disorders (such as emphysema, sinusitis, allergies and bronchitis); and gastrointestinal conditions (such as food allergies, ulcers, chronic diarrhea, constipation, indigestion, intestinal weakness, anorexia and gastritis). In 1997, a consensus statement released by the National Institutes of Health found that acupuncture could be useful by itself or in combination with other therapies to treat addiction, headaches, menstrual cramps, tennis elbow, fibromyalgia, myofascial pain, osteoarthritis, lower back pain, carpal tunnel syndrome and asthma. Other studies have demonstrated that acupuncture may help in the rehabilitation of stroke patients and can relieve nausea in patients recovering from surgery. What should I expect on my first visit? As with most health practitioners, the first visit to an acupuncturist usually begins with the practitioner taking a detailed history. Since traditional Chinese medicine takes a more holistic approach to patient care than Western medicine, you may be asked questions that appear unimportant (questions about your sleep habits, your ability to tolerate heat or cold, your dietary habits, etc.) but are actually vital to the type of care you will receive.

But Hattu refuses to accept her prophecies, adamant that there is one last chance for peace. This fragile hope lies in the borderlands of the east, where the two rival empires touch.

Washington (CNN) Sources confirm to CNN that Democratic Rep. Parker Griffith will announce Tuesday that he's switching parties and will run for re election next year as a Republican. The freshman lawmaker represents Alabama's 5th Congressional District. Griffith won his seat last year by 3 points over Republican Wayne Parker. But the district went for Republican John McCain over Barack Obama by 23 points in the presidential election. The Republican source was familiar with the decision but didn't want to preempt the announcement later Tuesday. The story was first reported by Politico. A Democratic aide also tells CNN Griffith is holding a staff meeting Tuesday morning to inform his staff of his decision, and will make a formal announcement at 2 p.m. ET. Griffith was one of 39 Democrats who voted against the party's health care reform bill last month. His is only one of three Democrats to have voted against the health care bill, the stimulus measure, and the cap and trade bill. Griffith pledged in August he would vote against House Speaker Nancy Pelosi as Speaker next session. With Griffith's switch of parties, the Democrats will hold a 257 178 advantage in the House of Representatives. CNN's Evan Glass and Paul Steinhauser contributed to this story Filed under: Parker Griffith Chris in NC Come on Heath. If Alabama can do it, so can North Carolina. December 22, 2009 03:13 pm at 3:13 pm | Parker Griffith? With a name like that, I am surpirsed he wasn' t already a Republican! Randy Sexton The PROOF will not be in his label of DEMOcrat or Republican, it will be in ACTIONS. It's never been more true than now that ACTIONS speak louder than words. We've heard the words of Prez ObeyMe, Nutcy Pelosi and Hairless Reid, among others, who have LIED, CHEATED, EXTORTED and BULLIED others into cramming bad legislation down our unwilling throats...We want people in Congress to get back to basics, SMALLer government, LESS taxation, LESS spending and MORE personal freedoms... Joe in CT not Lieberman!!! Remember, folks, he is running in Alabama. The last time they had a Democrat from that district was when LBJ passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, with no Southern Democrat and a lot of Republican support. The Republicans then offered the Southern Democrats home in their party. Talk about a three finger gagger! What if they manage to unseat Nancy Pelosi as Speaker of the House and replace her with someone who has a clue. Then will Griffith stay with the Democrats? If not, how will it feel to be the most junior member of the minority party? Perusing through WELL, WE ALL KNOW WHAT THIS IS ABOUT, , , , , It is called ""Self Preservation"" and doing what ever it takes to stay in office. Congressman Parker Griffith knows that after winning his Republican district by 3 points in the previous race, he can only hope to win his district which is full of Tea Baggers by putting on a Red Republican coat. He's a first term Democrat (in name only) from ALABAMA...what would you expect? The GOP owns the Deep South and visca versa. They were meant for each other! I love those ""open minded"" liberals who chose to respond to this story by showing their bigotry and trashing the state of Alabama and the South in general The same state that birthed such Americans as Harper Lee, Hank Aaron, and Rosa Parks. Disgusting. You should be ashamed. Shaun Landry Well, I guess the people who voted him in are not going to vote him back in for re election right? Oba Mao Most of the American people will be abandoning the socialist Democrats in 2010 and 2012, and maybe for a long time. They are committing suicide with this bill and others they are supporting. According to Rasmussen Obama's disaproval numbers have shot up to 56% since he BOUGHT the 60 votes and he has an approval index of 21. The mandate last year was to fix the economy, not socialize the country. They've ignored all the polls, the town halls, the tea parties, and the NJ and VA elections. Lets see if they can ignore the election results in 11 months when the Dems are sent packing. The good news is the bill can be undone before it goes into effext in 4 yrs. Mike in San Antonio Wow...I didn't hear the Dems all whining and complaining when Sen Arlen Specter did the same, except it was to the Democratic party. Will one of you liberal democrats please tell where exactly your hypocrisy ends? JoePoverty He'll be back. Alabama doesn't rank very high in terms of education, but even ignorant people will eventually understand that paying lower healthcare insurance premiums leaves them with more money to spend on other things like guns, TV's and BBQ. Once this goes into effect, Alabamans will be wondering why they bought in to the GOP's mis information campaign to protect Big Insurance. Parker You could have been a hero to the working poor of Alabama. How much did Healthsouth have to contribute to your campaign? Republicans get over it you have lost! and will not win 2010 With 35 million people uninsured, No !!American should die simply because they don't have health insurance , The 35 millions is not going to volt for you ? joec Good Job Mr. Griffith it is much better to be part of the minority than to be part of a party that takes bribes to pass legislation on 1/6th of the nations economy on a striaght party line vote. Goodbye Sen. Nelson from Nebraska your time is almost over in the Senate. Sailor Bob Look at all that hate from the left! It's in their usernames.. Jim Jeffords anybody? His defection actually cost the Republicans the majority. Libs seemed to approve of that defection. I love seeing them cry now over a mere single congressman...Keep spouting your sterotypes of the south..The only bigots here are Liberals Nathan from Atlanta He jumped to save his job. smlbusowner The bashing of the state of Alabama is amazing!!! FYI Madison County has more PHD's per capita then any other county in the U.S. We are educated and sick of liberals telling us what to do with our lives. Sorry that we are hard working, God fearing, family oriented people.

December 22, 2009 02:35 pm at 2:35 pm | When will we see the day when someone run's; not for themselves? but for the good of the people. And that goes for both sides!!. What happened to making this country better for all people? Not just running for office to get what you can for yourself. If you don't get your way in the Dem party switch to the Rep. It's all about the $$$$$$ and the power. Not the PEOPLE!!! Hehehehe. Looks like some people are waking up to the Mao wanna be's in our government. The libtards are going to get a beating in 2010. The Democrats don't need him. He probably was a Republican from inside. California_is_dying The Rats are fleeing the sinking ship !! Looks like that Hope and Change will happen next November..... Rebel With A Cause Don't let the door hit you on the way out, Bubba! Call Sessions and do some ""splainin"" as to why you ran as a Democrat in the first place. As a 23 year old Democrat living in Alabama's 5th Congressional district (the north part of the state think Huntsville, AL), and seeing his voting record, this is extremely disappointing but it does not surprise me. I will NOT be voting for Mr. Griffith as a Republican in 2010, if he even gets the nomination. I had already planned on voting on whoever challenged him in the Democratic primaries next year anyway. Good riddance, perhands we can elect an actual Democrat to represent us in 2010. Isn't he already a republican, For God's sake, he's from Alabama. All he needs is a hood and cloak. Walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, must be a republiduck, just ask Joe Lieberduck. Just follow the money.... This Independent says, ""Bravo!"" To all those that feel its wrong for him to swtich parties. How about the Specter switching and voting for so call health care reform?? I guess you are fine with that? How about breaking the standing rules in Mass about electing a new senator?? Forget the electoral process and just appoint someone becasue you need the vote. I guess you dont care about that either? How about Burris being sworn in while there is still questions about if he bought the seat? I guess you dont care abou tthat?? There are 3 votes that were obtained under questionable circumstances. Lets ignore for a moment the other votes that were bought with my tax dollars. Liberals house and senate members includes Reid will soon know what it feels like to be told you're fired!!!! now please help save this country! I'm from Alabama and the state votes along racial lines and just about every white person votes for a Republican, especially in the southern portion of the state. They're a bunch of bigots; you should hear my Republican family speak behind closed doors. These are the same people who just can't get over the fact that Obama is actually a Christian and still believe he's a closet Muslim! It's a wonder that guy ever got elected in Alabama as a Democrat to begin with. I'm glad I don't live there anymore. The ignorance there makes me sick. If this yahoo is a Republican at heart, I'm glad he's not posing anymore. Anyhow, the American people are a fickle bunch. The GOP truly is the Greedy Obstructionist Party. If Americans are so stupid that they'd vote more of the Republicans in, then we'll have to deal with that later. As for me, I'd like to not see another friend die because she didn't have insurance and ended up in a hospital that wanted their bed for the next person and forced her out twice instead of doing the tests that were needed. I'd also like to see our educational system improved so that we aren't the joke of the rest of the industrialized world! I decided I'd never vote as a Republican again when they couldn't even be bothered to fund schools. Ignorance is bliss if you run the GOP! Ron in Palm Springs Funny when this recently happened with Arlen Specter, the Libs praised him and how he had ""Seen the light"" & ""Had opened his eyes"". Now that the tables are turned it's ""OMG How could he do this to his voters"" or ""What a scumbag"". Hypocrites! Liberalism works great in Utopia, but not in Real Life. SouthPhillyBallz How utterly pointless. This guy's switch won't change his votes and is only an attempt to get re elected by his red state constituents. He was obviously never a Democrat in the first place. This is seriously a non issue. JK Ashburn, VA A whole bunch of you libs have been complaining about these moderate Dems and your desire to get rid of them. It has begun. Now, you'll valiantly talk about how you can run a ""real"" Dem to re capture the seat in 2010. Good luck with that. A whole bunch of these moderates won these seats ONLY because they campaigned as moderates (or even conservatives). With the reality of how they voted on idiotic things like stimulus, the budget, health care, and cap and trade, they'll now either be proven to be moderates or not and their districts will react accordingly. Either way, libs, you'll get your way fewer moderate Democrats. But, they won't be showing up in the lib column either. Griffith only won last year because he was running against an even bigger loser. There are two more popular Republicans already in the primary. 2010 will now almost certainly see the first Republican from the Alabama 5th since Reconstruction. And to whoever asked, yes Wallace was a democrat before he created a 3rd party. All of the pro segregation heavyweights were democrats. How quickly they forget... jm for sc Alabama is a republican state. He is switching parties because he want to win. Follow his career and see if he doesn't lose his next election. Obama will win his next election regardless of how people try to make things seem. How can people be so foolish to think this president can correct Bush's mess in only a few months. People really don't understand what is going on. Republicans will say anything to get back in power. Some can't stand the idea of having a black leader, which is the main problem for most people. I guess if they get to heaven and find that God is not of their race, they would want to live in hell. C Spurgeon Well with ethics like that he belongs in the republican party...Hopefully they can find a democrat to beat him but either way don't need wimps like that to pretend they are a dem... I'm just amazed. Here is another politician that's putting a political party first and the best interests of the country second. Who cares if he's a Republican or Democrat. Clearly this headline seeking tool is not a man of independent thought and needs to hide behind political party games. Neither party is good for this country, but this guy is just blowing with wind to get re elected. Alabama is a good for nothing, bible thumping, gay hating, sexist, racist, classist, anti semitic, republican, fly over black hole. We should charge the state for all of the war funding! He was just another dixiecrat. No big lost @ all. Mr Joshua Could be he saw Rasmuessens poll. 56 percent now disaprove of Obama's policies. He just does not want to be associated with a one term President that is going to be remembered far worse than Carter currently is. Ole Jimmy must be very happy! American Feminist ima goodblogger you realize that only 30% of registered voters call themselves true Republicans, right? Next election, those of us who are ""disenchanted"" with the Democrats aren't going to vote for a RepubliCANT. We just possibly won't vote. I'm not going to forget who screwed up our nation, and neither will the remaining 70% of voters. HINT: It wasn't the Democrats.",0.9234436

Additionally, environmental improvements in both areas began to improve prior to the 1970s when both laws were enacted.

Washington ""Bukka"" White (November 12, 1909 February 26, 1977) was an African American Delta blues guitarist and singer. ""Bukka"" is a phonetic spelling of White's first name, placed on the labels of his early recordings. He preferred the proper spelling of his name, ""Booker,"" as he was named after the well known African American educator and civil rights activist Booker T. Washington. White was born south of Houston, Mississippi. He was a first cousin of B.B. King's mother (White's mother and King's grandmother were sisters). He is remembered as a player of National resonator guitars. He also played piano, but less adeptly. He typically played slide guitar, in an open tuning. He was one of the few, along with Skip James, to use a crossnote tuning in E minor, which he may have learned, as James did, from Henry Stuckey. White started his career playing the fiddle at square dances. He claimed to have met Charlie Patton soon after, but some have doubted this recollection. Nonetheless, Patton was a strong influence on White. He first recorded for Victor Records in 1930. His recordings for Victor, like those of many other bluesmen, included country blues and gospel music. Victor published his photograph in 1930. His gospel songs were done in the style of Blind Willie Johnson, with a female singer accentuating the last phrase of each line. Nine years later, while serving time for assault, he recorded for the folklorist John Lomax. The few songs he recorded around this time became his most well known: ""Shake 'Em On Down,"" and ""Po' Boy."" His 1937 version of the oft recorded song ""Shake 'Em on Down,"" is considered definitive; it became a hit while White was serving time in Parchman. One of his most famous songs, ""Parchman Farm Blues"", about the Mississippi State Penitentiary (also known as Parchman Farm) in Sunflower County, Mississippi, was released on Harry Smith's fourth volume of the Anthology of American Folk Music, Vol. 4. Bob Dylan covered his song ""Fixin' to Die Blues"", which aided a ""rediscovery"" of White in 1963 by guitarist John Fahey and Ed Denson, which propelled him into the folk revival of the 1960s. White had recorded the song simply because his other songs had not particularly impressed the Victor record producer. It was a studio composition of which White had thought little until it re emerged thirty years later. Fahey and Denson found White easily enough: Fahey wrote a letter to ""Bukka White (Old Blues Singer), c/o General Delivery, Aberdeen, Mississippi."" Fahey had assumed, given White's song ""Aberdeen, Mississippi"", that White still lived there or nearby. The postcard was forwarded to Memphis, Tennessee, where White worked in a tank factory. Fahey and Denson soon traveled to meet White, and White and Fahey remained friends through the remainder of White's life. He recorded a new album for Denson and Fahey's Takoma Records, whilst Denson became his manager. White was at one time also managed by experienced blues manager Arne Brogger. Later in his life, White was friends with the musician Furry Lewis. The two recorded an album (mostly in Lewis's Memphis apartment), Furry Lewis, Bukka White & Friends: Party! At Home. White died of cancer in February 1977, at the age of 67, in Memphis, Tennessee. In 1990 he was posthumously inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame (along with Blind Blake and Lonnie Johnson). On November 21, 2011, the Recording Academy announced that ""Fixin' to Die Blues"" was to be added to its 2012 list of Grammy Hall of Fame Award recipients. The Led Zeppelin song ""Hats Off to (Roy) Harper"", on the band's 1970 album Led Zeppelin III, was based in large part on White's ""Shake 'Em on Down."" ""Custard Pie"", a song on Led Zeppelin's 1975 album Physical Graffiti, also references ""Shake 'Em on Down."" The 1963 recordings of White's song ""Shake 'Em on Down"" and spoken word piece ""Remembrance of Charlie Patton"" were both sampled by electronic artist Recoil (mostly a one man effort by Alan Wilder of Depeche Mode) for the track ""Electro Blues for Bukka White"" on the 1992 album Bloodline. The song was reworked and re released on the 2000 EP Jezebel. In 1995, White's ""Aberdeen, Mississippi"" was covered as ""Aberdeen"" by guitarist Kenny Wayne Shepherd on his debut album, Ledbetter Heights. It reached number 23 on the Billboard (North America) Mainstream Rock Tracks in 1996. On January 26, 2010, Eric Bibb released Booker's Guitar (TEL 31756 02) through Telarc International Corporation after becoming inspired by the hidden stories Bibb felt through holding White's famous guitar. White's song ""Parchman Farm Blues"" was recorded by Jeff Buckley, and was released posthumously on the bonus disc of Buckley's album Grace: Legacy Edition.

Washington ""Bukka"" White (November 12, 1909 February 26, 1977) was an African American Delta blues guitarist and singer. ""Bukka"" is a phonetic spelling of White's first name, placed on the labels of his early recordings. He preferred the proper spelling of his name, ""Booker,"" as he was named after the well known African American educator and civil rights activist Booker T. Washington. White was born south of Houston, Mississippi. He was a first cousin of B.B. King's mother (White's mother and King's grandmother were sisters). He is remembered as a player of National resonator guitars. He also played piano, but less adeptly. He typically played slide guitar, in an open tuning. He was one of the few, along with Skip James, to use a crossnote tuning in E minor, which he may have learned, as James did, from Henry Stuckey. White started his career playing the fiddle at square dances. He claimed to have met Charlie Patton soon after, but some have doubted this recollection. Nonetheless, Patton was a strong influence on White. He first recorded for Victor Records in 1930. His recordings for Victor, like those of many other bluesmen, included country blues and gospel music. Victor published his photograph in 1930. His gospel songs were done in the style of Blind Willie Johnson, with a female singer accentuating the last phrase of each line. Nine years later, while serving time for assault, he recorded for the folklorist John Lomax. The few songs he recorded around this time became his most well known: ""Shake 'Em On Down,"" and ""Po' Boy."" His 1937 version of the oft recorded song ""Shake 'Em on Down,"" is considered definitive; it became a hit while White was serving time in Parchman. One of his most famous songs, ""Parchman Farm Blues"", about the Mississippi State Penitentiary (also known as Parchman Farm) in Sunflower County, Mississippi, was released on Harry Smith's fourth volume of the Anthology of American Folk Music, Vol. 4. Bob Dylan covered his song ""Fixin' to Die Blues"", which aided a ""rediscovery"" of White in 1963 by guitarist John Fahey and Ed Denson, which propelled him into the folk revival of the 1960s. White had recorded the song simply because his other songs had not particularly impressed the Victor record producer. It was a studio composition of which White had thought little until it re emerged thirty years later. Fahey and Denson found White easily enough: Fahey wrote a letter to ""Bukka White (Old Blues Singer), c/o General Delivery, Aberdeen, Mississippi."" Fahey had assumed, given White's song ""Aberdeen, Mississippi"", that White still lived there or nearby. The postcard was forwarded to Memphis, Tennessee, where White worked in a tank factory. Fahey and Denson soon traveled to meet White, and White and Fahey remained friends through the remainder of White's life. He recorded a new album for Denson and Fahey's Takoma Records, whilst Denson became his manager. White was at one time also managed by experienced blues manager Arne Brogger. Later in his life, White was friends with the musician Furry Lewis. The two recorded an album (mostly in Lewis's Memphis apartment), Furry Lewis, Bukka White & Friends: Party! At Home. White died of cancer in February 1977, at the age of 67, in Memphis, Tennessee. In 1990 he was posthumously inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame (along with Blind Blake and Lonnie Johnson). On November 21, 2011, the Recording Academy announced that ""Fixin' to Die Blues"" was to be added to its 2012 list of Grammy Hall of Fame Award recipients. The Led Zeppelin song ""Hats Off to (Roy) Harper"", on the band's 1970 album Led Zeppelin III, was based in large part on White's ""Shake 'Em on Down."" ""Custard Pie"", a song on Led Zeppelin's 1975 album Physical Graffiti, also references ""Shake 'Em on Down."" The 1963 recordings of White's song ""Shake 'Em on Down"" and spoken word piece ""Remembrance of Charlie Patton"" were both sampled by electronic artist Recoil (mostly a one man effort by Alan Wilder of Depeche Mode) for the track ""Electro Blues for Bukka White"" on the 1992 album Bloodline. The song was reworked and re released on the 2000 EP Jezebel. In 1995, White's ""Aberdeen, Mississippi"" was covered as ""Aberdeen"" by guitarist Kenny Wayne Shepherd on his debut album, Ledbetter Heights. It reached number 23 on the Billboard (North America) Mainstream Rock Tracks in 1996. On January 26, 2010, Eric Bibb released Booker's Guitar (TEL 31756 02) through Telarc International Corporation after becoming inspired by the hidden stories Bibb felt through holding White's famous guitar. White's song ""Parchman Farm Blues"" was recorded by Jeff Buckley, and was released posthumously on the bonus disc of Buckley's album Grace: Legacy Edition.
